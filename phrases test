2 F: Thus, air flow through the gas turbine engine can be controlled, in part, by using variable vanes and such variable vanes have been used to control the incidence of air flow onto rotor blades of subsequent compressor stages under different operating conditions.
2 S: However, the inclusion of variable vanes in the low-pressure compressor, as well as the associated linkages and actuators, necessarily adds additional weight to the gas turbine engine as well as increasing cost and complexity of manufacturing the gas turbine engine.

3 F:When such a flexible display apparatus is greatly bent, stress due to bending is transmitted to a thin film transistor, and thus, cracks are generated, whereby the properties of the thin film transistor are deteriorated.
3 S:However, when source and drain electrodes are formed using a metal electrode, they have a drawback of being vulnerable to high current stress and temperature.

4 F:Such inks or coating agents should exhibit excellent adhesion to different kinds of plastic films and should also exhibit blocking resistance and adaptability to boiling or retorting treatment.
4 S:However, polyurethane resins in which the urethane bond concentration is highly increased do not provide sufficient adaptability for printing or adhesion stability.

5 F:As the optical technique develops, solid-state lighting devices have great improvements in light-emitting efficiency, lifetime, and brightness.
5 S:However, the light generated by the LED may undergo totally internal reflection inside the semiconductor layers and the substrate.

6 F:Meanwhile, the inductance of the phases of the motor is changed by the position of the rotor of the motor, and accordingly, the current at the phases of the inverter may not be uniform.
6 S:In particular, when a phase has low inductance, current ripple is excessive, and thus, a current and a loss of the inverter increase and the temperature of power conversion devices of the inverter may increase.

7 F:By doing so, each node may participate in the network with anonymity, connection failure, or insufficient reliability.
7 S:However, private blockchains may be subject to reliability issues due to their centralized control system and consensus structure.

8 F:Although the pre-presence/absence-detection operation is superior in terms of productivity, in the case where the inserting paper is frequently inserted, there is a possibility that the inserting paper that should be inserted immediately before the transfer paper is run out before the transfer paper reaches the inserter and the print job is stopped.
8 S:However, in this method, a period from the time when the amount of inserting paper remaining in the inserting paper tray has become small to a time when the inserting paper tray is replenished with inserting paper, the productivity of the image forming system is low.

9 F:Although an output diode is passive and thus requires no synchronous rectifier control, the use of an output diode lowers efficiency as compared to a flyback converter with synchronous rectification.
9 S:The resulting conventional fault detection is only applicable during a start-up stage and cannot detect a partially-open fault condition, which is problematic with regard to ensuring reliability of the flyback converter.

10 F:Specifically, it is disclosed to mix the activated aromatic or heterocyclic aromatic compound and the nitrating agent with a solvent to reduce the concentration of the activated aromatic or heterocyclic aromatic compound and the nitrating agent to thereby restrain the temperature in the microreactor from being excessively raised by reaction heat that occurs accompanying the mixing of the activated aromatic or heterocyclic aromatic compound with the nitrating agent.
10 S:Although Patent Document 1 also discloses mixing an activated aromatic or heterocyclic aromatic compound with a nitrating agent under the condition of absence of solvent, such mixing causes the concentration of the substance contributing to the reaction in the mixed raw material solution to be high, which is likely to accelerate the reaction, making it difficult to control the temperature of the mixed raw material solution.
