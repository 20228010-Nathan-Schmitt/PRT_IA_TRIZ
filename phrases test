2 F: Air flow through the gas turbine engine can be controlled, in part, by using variable vanes and such variable vanes have been used to control the incidence of air flow onto rotor blades of subsequent compressor stages under different operating conditions.
2 S: However, the inclusion of variable vanes in the low-pressure compressor, as well as the associated linkages and actuators, necessarily adds additional weight to the gas turbine engine as well as increasing cost and complexity of manufacturing the gas turbine engine.
2 R: including variable vanes allow a better control of the air flow trough the engine, however it makes it heavier, more expensive and more complex to build.

4 F:Such inks or coating agents should exhibit excellent adhesion to different kinds of plastic films and should also exhibit blocking resistance and adaptability to boiling or retorting treatment.
4 S:However, polyurethane resins in which the urethane bond concentration is highly increased do not provide sufficient adaptability for printing or adhesion stability.
4 R: Such inks have excellent properties but they don't interact well with polyurethane

5 F:As the optical technique develops, solid-state lighting devices have great improvements in light-emitting efficiency, lifetime, and brightness.
5 S:However, the light generated by the LED may undergo total internal reflection inside the semiconductor layers and the substrate.
5 R:LED's lifetime, bightness and energy consumption have improved, however, light is not efficiently extracted from the LED and can be reflected inside the material, reducing the overall efficiency.

7 F:By doing so, each node may participate in the network with anonymity, connection failure, or insufficient reliability.
7 S:However, private blockchains may be subject to reliability issues due to their centralized control system and consensus structure.
7 R:Allowing nodes to participate in the blockchain with low reliability, low connection or anonymously will boost the systems's operability but it may cause reliability issues because of the centralised control and consensus architecture.
