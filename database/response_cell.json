                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Immunotherapy using adoptive transfer of tumor-specific T cells and chimeric antigen receptor CAR and T cell receptor TCR modified T cells mediates durable and complete disease regression in some patients with metastatic cancer. Recent studies have suggested that metabolism supports and drives many basic features of T cells, including cellular activation, proliferation, differentiation, effector function, and antitumor immunity. This has led to a growing interest in leveraging this understanding to improve the efficacy of T cell transfer therapies, such as adoptive transfer immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer. Although there is increasing evidence that metabolism can affect the survival and antitumor function of T cells, identifying a simple and clinically feasible method to isolate T cells with favorable metabolic features has proved challenging. Because mitochondria are the central metabolic organelle in cells, Sukumar et al. Cell Metabolism, 23:63-76, 2016 hypothesized that the measurement of a single mitochondrial-associated parameter may help to identify T cells with a favorable bioenergetic profile that can survive in vivo for long periods after adoptive transfer for T cell-based immunotherapy, such as CAR-T, TCR and chimeric T cell receptor cTCR based therapies. Sukumar et al. described a clinically feasible method to isolate functionally robust T cells based on a single metabolic parameter: mitochondrial membrane potential m. Mitochondria produce energy by establishing an electrochemical proton motive force p across their inner cell membrane, which in turn fuels the synthesis of ATP by driving the proton turbine F0F1 ATPase. Sukumar et al. utilized a lipophilic cationic dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester TMRM to identify and isolate metabolically robust T cells based on their mitochondrial membrane potential m. They showed that CD8+ T cells that are found to have low-m display enhanced in vivo persistence and greater antitumor immunity relative to high-m cells. Based on these findings, the authors claimed that they have demonstrated that metabolic sorting can complement sorting based on conventional cell surface markers in identifying cells with the capacity for long-term survival and ongoing effector function after adoptive transfer. They further believed that immunometabolomic approach to cell sorting may have important and immediate therapeutic applications in enhancing cell-based therapies for patients with viral-associated illness, advanced cancer, and disorders of hematopoiesis. However, sorting of lymphocytes based on TMRM staining and flow sorting is slow and expensive and therefore not readily amenable to clinical application.",

Chimeric antigen receptors CAR are artificial T cell receptors typically used as a therapy for cancer, using a technique called adoptive cell transfer. The essential antigen-binding, signaling, and stimulatory functions of the TCR complex have been reduced by genetic recombination methods to a single polypeptide chain, generally referred to as a Chimeric Antigen Receptor CAR. See, , Eshhar, 7,741,465; Eshhar, Patent Application Publication 2012/0093842. CARs are constructed specifically to stimulate T cell activation and proliferation in response to a specific antigen to which the CAR binds. Typically CAR-T cells are used, which refer to T-cells that have been engineered to containing a chimeric antigen receptor. Thus, T lymphocytes bearing such CARs are generally referred to as CAR-T lymphocytes. As described more fully, below, the disclosure provides for the isolation as well as isolated Pgp-positive cells that can be or are modified so that they express receptors that recognize proteins that are specific to the particular form of cancer. Such cells can be reintroduced to a subject, wherein the cells recognize and kill cancer cells. CARs have also been used for adoptive cell therapy of immune and infectious diseases. In addition to CAR, native, engineered and chimeric T cell receptors TCR have also been used for adoptive cell therapy. Disease targeted by genetically modified cells as used herein encompasses the targeting of any cell involved in any manner in any disease by a genetically modified cells the hones to the disease or a target tissue or cell type, irrespective of whether the genetically modified cells target diseased cells or healthy cells to effectuate a therapeutically beneficial result. Genetically modified cells, redirected cells, genetically engineered cells or modified cells as used herein refer to cells that have been modified to express a CAR and native, engineered or chimeric TCR. For example, a genetically modified T-lymphocyte that expresses a CAR is a genetically modified cell sometimes referred to as a CAR-T cell. Mammal as used herein refers to any member of the class Mammalia, including, without limitation, humans and nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses; domestic mammals such as dogs and cats; laboratory animals including rodents such as mice, rats and guinea pigs, and the like.

P-glycoprotein P-gp or Pgp is an ATP-dependent efflux pump with broad substrate specificity that pumps many foreign substances out of cells. P-glycoprotein is also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 MDR1 or ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 ABCB1 or cluster of differentiation 243 CD243. As used herein and as understood by one of skill in the art, Pgp-positive is abbreviated Pgp+ and Pgp-negative is abbreviated Pgp. Stem cells are cells capable of differentiation into other cell types and/or which retain the ability to continually replicate. Stem cells include those having a particular, specialized function , tissue specific cells, parenchymal cells and progenitors thereof. Progenitor cells i. e. , multipotent are cells that can give rise to different terminally differentiated cell types, and cells that are capable of giving rise to various progenitor cells. Cells that give rise to some or many, but not all, of the cell types of an organism are often termed pluripotent stem cells, which are able to differentiate into any cell type in the body of a mature organism. As will be appreciated, multipotent stem/progenitor cells have a more narrow differentiation potential than do pluripotent stem cells. Another class of cells even more primitive i. e. , uncommitted to a particular differentiation fate than pluripotent stem cells are the so-called totipotent stem cells , fertilized oocytes, cells of embryos at the two and four cell stages of development, which have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell of the particular species. For example, a single totipotent stem cell could give rise to a complete animal, as well as to any of the myriad of cell types found in the particular species , humans. Moreover, in the case of lymphocytes a stem cell lymphocyte or lymphocyte progenitor can be a lymphocyte that has not been activated to target a particular antigen. Such lymphocyte progenitors retain the ability to be activated to target a particular antigen. Such lymphocyte progenitor cells are particularly useful in generating CAR-T cells as the progenitors can be readily targeted using a recombinant CAR and have greater replicative potential. Stem cells and progenitor cells of the disclosure include CD34+ cells. The term pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell refers to a hematopoietic stem cell that can give rise to all blood cell types. Target cell as used herein refers to cells which are involved in a disease and can be targeted to prevent or treat a disease condition by genetically modified cells of the disclosure including but not limited to genetically modified T-cells, NK cells, hematopoietic stem cells, pluripotent stem cells, and embryonic stem cells. Other target cells will be apparent to those of skill in the art and may be used in connection with alternate embodiments of the disclosure. The terms T-cell and T-lymphocyte are interchangeable and used synonymously herein. Examples include but are not limited to nave T cells lymphocyte progenitors, central memory T cells, effector memory T cells, stem memory T cells Tscm or combinations thereof. Pgp positive lymphocytes of the disclosure include the following:1 T cellsa Pgp+ T cells and subsets as defined by one or more immunological markers, such as CD8+, CD4+, CD62L+, CCR7+ etc. ; b Pgp+ T cells can also include different stages of differentiation, such as nave T cells lymphocyte progenitors, central memory T cells, effector memory T cells, memory stem T cells TSCM etc. ; c Pgp+ T cells can also include different functional subclasses, such as Helper T cells, Cytotoxic T cells, Natural Killer T cells or regulatory T cells etc. ; and d Pgp+ T cells can also be classified based on the site from which they are obtained, such as peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, tissue resident lymphocytes, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes etc. ; and2 NK Cells Natural Killer cellsa Pgp+ NK cells and subsets as defined by one or more immunological markers, such as CD56hi, CD56lo etc. ; b Pgp+ NK cells can also include NK cells at different stages of differentiation, such as nave NK cells etc. ; c Pgp+ NK cells can also be classified based on the site from which they are obtained, such as peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, tissue resident lymphocytes, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes etc. Pgp negative lymphocytes , for use in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation to reduce the incidence of GVHD include the following subsets:1 T cellsa Pgp T cells and subsets as defined by one or more immunological markers, such as CD8+, CD4+, CD62L+, CCR7+ etc. ; b Pgp T cells can also include T cells at different stages of differentiation, such as nave T cells lymphocyte progenitors, central memory T cells, effector memory T cells, memory stem T cells TSCM etc. ; c Pgp T cells can also include cells belonging to different functional subclasses, such as Helper T cells, Cytotoxic T cells, Natural Killer T cells or regulatory T cells etc. ; and d Pgp T cells can also be classified based on the site from which they are obtained, such as peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, tissue resident lymphocytes, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes etc. The disclosure also covers methods to isolate hematopoietic stem cells for cellular and gene therapy applications using method that include one or more of 1 physical stress , hyperthermia, 2 nutritional and/or metabolic stress including, but not limited to, serum starvation and/or growth factor starvation; 3 chemical , exposure to chemotoxic compounds; and 4 exposure to Pgp-transported phototoxic compounds. The disclosure also demonstrates that Pgp expression correlates with the degree of stem-ness of a T or NK cell so that the cells with the highest level of Pgp expression are likely to be the most primitive or most stem like. Treatment and treating, as used herein refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen the targeted pathologic condition, prevent the pathologic condition, pursue or obtain beneficial results, or lower the chances of the individual developing the condition even if the treatment is ultimately unsuccessful. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition as well as those prone to have the condition or those in whom the condition is to be prevented. Tumor, as used herein refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. As mentioned Sukumar et al. taught that robust lymphocyte were identifiable based on low mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, the present disclosure provides methods and compositions to identify robust lymphocyte cells using markers and methods that are easier and clinically feasible. The disclosure demonstrates that P-glycoprotein P-gp or Pgp expression is a strong indicator of lymphocyte differentiation and biological activity. Moreover, the disclosure provides various dyes, chemotherapeutic agents, nutritional and/or metabolic and physical stresses useful for selecting robust lymphocyte cell types. The cells and methods described herein use, in some cases, one or more markers wherein at least one marker is Pgp. A molecule is a marker of a desired cell type if it is found on a sufficiently high percentage of cells of the desired cell type, and found on a sufficiently low percentage of cells of an undesired cell type. One can achieve a desired level of purification of the desired cell type from a population of cells comprising both desired and undesired cell types by selecting for cells in the population of cells that have the marker. A marker can be displayed on, for example, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more of the desired cell type, and can be displayed on fewer than 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 1% or fewer of an undesired cell type. In one embodiment, the disclosure provides Pgp+ cells, individually or in populations. The term isolated or purified when referring to a cells of the disclosure means cells that are substantially free of cells lacking the phenotypic marker , Pgp or vice versa. In particular embodiments, the cells are at least 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99% free of a contaminating cell types , Pgp+ or Pgp cells as the case may be. In another embodiment, the isolated cells also are substantially free of soluble, naturally occurring molecules. A Pgp+ cell of the disclosure, for example, can be 99%-100% purified by, for example, flow cytometry , FACS analysis, as discussed herein. In one embodiment, the disclosure provides an enriched population of Pgp+ or Pgp cells depending upon the desired selection criteria. An enriched population of cells is one wherein a desired cell-type of the disclosure has been partially separated from other cell types, such that the resulting population of cells has a greater concentration of Pgp+ or Pgp cells than the original population of cells they type of desired cell with depend upon whether you are selecting for or against Pgp expression. The enriched population of cells can have greater than about a 1. 5-fold, 2-fold, 10-fold, 100-fold, 500-fold, 1,000-fold, 2,000-fold, 3,000-fold, 4,000-fold, 5,000-fold, 6,000-fold, 7,000-fold, 8,000-fold, 9,000-fold, 10,000-fold or greater concentration of, , Pgp+ cells than the original population had prior to separation. Pgp+ cells of the disclosure can, for example, make up at least 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 35%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more of the enriched population of stem cells. The enriched population of cells may be obtained by, for example, selecting against cells displaying lacking a Pgp marker. Alternatively, or in addition to, the enrichment for the expression of a marker, the loss of expression of a marker may also be used for enrichment. For example, lack of expression of a marker , Pgp can be used to select cells. In another embodiment, the disclosure uses chemotherapeutic agents to select robust lymphocyte cells. As mentioned above, Pgp is a multidrug resistance protein that pumps a broad range of substrates, including harmfuls substrates such as chemotherapeutics, out of cells. Thus, cells that express Pgp including high levels of Pgp are more resistant to chemotherapeutics. Accordingly, contacting a population of cells expressing various levels of Pgp with a chemotherapeutics will select for those cells that have higher expression levels of Pgp compared to those with no or low level expression of Pgp. Similarly, dyes , photosensitive dyes can be used in a similar fashion. In this embodiment, cells that express or over express Pgp will tend to pump out or exclude the dye compared to cells with low or no Pgp expression. Dye-containing cells can be separate from non-dye-containing cells. Moreover, if the dye is toxic or can be photoactivatated, cells that contain the dye can be killed thus retaining the Pgp expressing cells. The disclosure also demonstrates that exposing cells to physical stresses, such as hyperthermic conditions, can provide selection. For example, exposing lymphocytes to higher temperatures for short periods of time provides a selective advantage to cells that express or over express Pgp compared to cells that do no expression Pgp. The disclosure also demonstrates that exposing cells to serum-starvation and growth factor-starvation conditions can provide enrichment. For example, exposing peripheral blood stem cells to serum starvation for short periods of time results in enrichment of CD34+ cells that express or coexpress Pgp. As disclosed herein, T cells expressing Pgp have better capacity for long-term survival and ongoing effector function after adoptive transfer. Thus, in one embodiment, expression and/or activity of P-glycoprotein can be used to select lymphocytes for adoptive cellular therapy including, but not limited to, genetic modification by CAR to produce CAR-T cells, TCRs and chimeric TCRs. Since P-glycoprotein is a cell surface protein and there a number of antibodies available against it, the current disclosure provides a method of selecting lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapy based on P-glycoprotein expression. The P-glycoprotein positive cells of the disclosure can be isolated using a number of techniques known in the art, such as magnetic activated cell sorting MACS, in addition to conventional flow sorting. These techniques have the advantage over the method proposed by Sukumar et al. in that they are quick, economical and amenable to clinical application as a number of systems for MACS are already in clinical use. For example, Miltenyi Biotech markets a system for MACS that has FDA approval and is in clinical use in several centers. P-glycoprotein expression can also be combined with positive and negative selection of other markers , CD8, CD4, CD62L, CD44, to further enrich lymphocytes with stem-like property and/or to enrich for stem-like T cells belonging to different subsets cytotoxic, helper, Treg, for adoptive cellular therapy. Provided herein are methods for isolating cells suitable for adoptive cell therapy. In one embodiment the methods comprise obtaining a sample, enriching the sample for T cells, mononuclear cells, NK cells, and/or stem cells and isolating p-glycoprotein positive Pgp+ T cells, mononuclear cells, NK cells and/or stem cells from the enriched sample, so as to obtain a fraction enriched in Pgp+ T cells, NK cells, and/or stem cells suitable for adoptive cell transfer therapy. In some embodiments, the step of enriching the sample for T cells, mononuclear cells, NK cells and/or stem cells can be omitted. In some embodiments, isolating the Pgp+ T cells, NK cells and/or stem cells from the sample comprises exposing the sample to at least one primary antibody or antibody-like moiety specific to p-glycoprotein. In some embodiments, the at least one primary antibody or antibody-like moiety is conjugated to at least one fluorescent label or at least one magnetic label. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise optionally staining the sample with at least one secondary antibody. In some embodiments, the at least one secondary antibody is conjugated to at least one fluorescent label or at least one magnetic label. In some embodiments, isolating of the Pgp+ T cells, NK cells and/or stem cells from the sample is performed by any one or more methods selected from immunofluorescent methods, immunomagnetic methods, immunoaffinity methods or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, isolating of the Pgp+ T cells, NK cells and/or stem cells from the sample is performed by any one or more methods selected from flow cytometry, magnetic activated cell sorting, biotin-streptavidin based affinity purification or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, Pgp+ T cells, NK cells and/or stem cells can be isolated from a sample blood, bone marrow, leukopheresis sample, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a single step by simultaneous labeling with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against Pgp and other cellular markers associated with the cell type , T cell markers such as CD3 followed by sorting for Pgp+/marker2 , followed by sorting for Pgp+/CD3+ T cells by flow sorting. In some embodiments, Pgp+ T cell subsets can be isolated from a sample blood, bone marrow, leukopheresis sample, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a single step by simultaneous labeling with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against Pgp and T cell subset markers CD4, CD8, followed by sorting for Pgp+/CD4+ or Pgp+/CD8+ T cells by flow sorting. In addition to separation of Pgp expressing cells based on surface labeling with Pgp antibodies, the disclosure provides methods of isolation/purification/enrichment of lymphocytes for adoptive cellular therapy based on Pgp activity. A number of cytotoxic drugs, such as Vincristine, vinnblastin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, taxol, paclitaxol, etoposide, mitoxantrone, actinomycin-D, etc. are substrates of Pgp. Therefore, Pgp-expressing cells can be enriched by exposing T cells to appropriate concentration of the above drugs that will kill Pgp-negative cells, thus isolating/purifying/enriching Pgp+ cells. In another embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for isolating cells suitable for adoptive cell therapy, comprising obtaining a sample, enriching the sample for T cells, contacting the sample with at least one cytotoxic drug at a concentration appropriate to kill Pgp T cells, and isolating Pgp+ T cells from the enriched sample, so as to isolate cells suitable for adoptive cell transfer therapy. In another embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for isolating cells suitable for adoptive cell therapy, comprising obtaining a sample, enriching the sample for mononuclear cells, contacting the sample with at least one cytotoxic drug at a concentration appropriate to kill Pgp mononuclear cells, and isolating Pgp+ mononuclear cells from the enriched sample, so as to isolate cells suitable for adoptive cell transfer therapy. In some embodiments, the step of enriching the sample for T cells or mononuclear cells can be omitted prior to contain the cells with a cytotoxic drug. In some embodiments, the cytotoxic drugs are any one or more of vincristine, vinnblastin, doxorubicin, or taxol, or combinations thereof. In any of the foregoing embodiments, the cell population enriched for Pgp+ cells can be further processed using antibodies to markers on the cells , anti-Pgp antibodies, dyes, or hyperthermic conditions. In some embodiments, isolating the Pgp+ T cells from the sample comprises exposing the sample to at least one primary antibody or antibody like moiety specific to p-glycoprotein. In some embodiments, the at least one primary antibody or antibody like moiety is conjugated to at least one fluorescent label or at least one magnetic label. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise optionally staining the sample with at least one secondary antibody. In some embodiments, the at least one secondary antibody is conjugated to at least one fluorescent label or at least one magnetic label. In some embodiments, isolating of the Pgp+ T cells from the sample is performed by any one or more methods selected from immunofluorescent methods, immunomagnetic methods, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, isolating of the Pgp positive T cells from the sample is performed by any one or more methods selected from flow cytometry, magnetic activated cell sorting, or combinations thereof. In addition, Pgp expressing cells can be purified/enriched/isolated using photodynamic dye treatment. For example, Pgp expression cells can be purified/enriched/isolated with rhodamine analogs that are differentially retained between Pgp+ and Pgp cells and become phototoxic on exposure to visible light. This method can be used alone or in combination with other methods of selection described herein. Exemplary rhodamine and rhodamine derivatives are known and include, for example, derivatives selected from the group consisting of 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid methyl ester hydrochloride; 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride; 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid octyl ester hydrochloride; 4,5-dibromorhodamine 110 n-butyl ester 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid n-butyl ester hydrochloride; Rhodamine B n-butyl ester 2-6-ethyl amino-3-ethyl imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid n-butyl ester hydrochloride; and photoactivable derivatives thereof; whereby photoactivation of said derivatives induces cell killing while unactivated derivatives are substantially non-toxic to cells. Other phototoxic compounds that are substrate of Pgp have been described in the literature as well and can be used in the method of the current disclosure. For example, using a rhodamine or rhodamine analog, a population of cells can be contacted with a rhodamine or rhodamine analog under sufficient concentrations and time that allow for cells to take up the rhodamine or rhodamine analog. As described herein and above, Pgp expressing cells will pump the rhodamine or rhodamine analog out of the cell, while Pgp or cells having reduced Pgp expression will retain the rhodamine or rhodamine analog. The population is then contacted with a light of a wavelength that causes ablation of cells containing the rhodamine or rhodamine analog i. e. , cells lacking or having reduced Pgp expression. Thus, the population will be enriched for Pgp+ cells by photo-ablation of Pgp cells. Due to the specific retention of the rhodamine 123 Rh123 class of dyes by Pgp cells and the concomitant lack of their accumulation by the lymphocytes with stem-like phenotype , by Pgp+, the disclosure provides a method for the use of these dyes for in vivo or in vitro photodynamic therapy to enrich lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapy. Since low staining with TMRM, Rh123 and DiOC23 correlates with and/or is primarily due to Pgp mediated efflux and is not solely due to low mitochondrial membrane potential, the disclosure teaches an optimized protocol for isolation of Pgp expressing cells by optimizing Pgp mediated efflux. For example, by performing the assay at 37 C. and by allowing more time for Pgp mediated efflux of the dyes, a better differentiation can be obtained between Pgp+ and Pgp cells for the purpose of adoptive cellular therapy. In another embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for isolating cells suitable for adoptive cell therapy, comprising obtaining a sample, enriching the sample for T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells, contacting the sample with at least one phototoxic compound, exposing the sample to a visible light source sufficient to activate the at least one phototoxic compound so as to kill Pgp T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells, and isolating Pgp+ T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells from the enriched sample, so as to isolate cells suitable for adoptive cell transfer therapy. This method can be used alone or in combination with other methods for Pgp+ cell enrichment. In some embodiments, the step of enriching the sample for T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells can be omitted. In some embodiments, the phototoxic compounds are any one or more of 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid methyl ester hydrochloride, 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride, 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid octyl ester hydrochloride, 2-4,5-dibromo-6-amino-3-imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid n-butyl ester hydrochloride, 2-6-ethyl amino-3-ethyl imino-3H-xanthen-9-yl-benzoic acid n-butyl ester hydrochloride, or derivatives thereof or combinations thereof. For example, using a phototoxic, a population of cells can be contacted with a phototoxic compound under sufficient concentrations and time that allow for cells to take up the phototoxic compound. As described herein and above, Pgp expressing cells will pump the phototoxic compound out of the cell, while Pgp or cells having reduced Pgp expression will retain the phototoxic compound. The population is then contacted with a light of a wavelength that causes ablation of cells containing the phototoxic compound i. e. , cells lacking or having reduced Pgp expression. Thus, the population will be enriched for Pgp+ cells by photo-ablation of Pgp cells. In another embodiment, physical methods, such as temperature exposure, can be used to select for CD34+ and/or Pgp+ cells. In this embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for isolating cells suitable for adoptive cell therapy, comprising obtaining a sample, enriching the sample for T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells, culturing the cells and exposing the population of cells to hyperthermia so as to kill Pgp T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells, and isolating/enriching for Pgp+ T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells. In one embodiment, the cells are exposed to a temperature from about 40-42 C. for 2-4 hours. In one embodiment, the temperature is 42-43 C. In another embodiment, the temperature is 42 C. for 2-3 hours. In another embodiment, the temperature is 43 C. for 2-3 hours. This method can be used alone or in combination with other methods for Pgp+ cell enrichment. In some embodiments, the step of enriching the sample for T cells, NK cells, stem cells, and/or mononuclear cells can be omitted. For example, using a hyperthermic temperature during culturing, a population of cells can be enriched for Pgp+ cells. In another embodiment, temperature exposure can be used to select for Pgp+/CD34+ cells. In this embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for isolating cells suitable for adoptive cell therapy, comprising obtaining a sample, enriching the sample for T cells or mononuclear cells, culturing the cells and exposing the population of cells to hyperthermia so as to kill Pgp T, NK or mononuclear cells, and isolating/enriching for Pgp+ stem cells and mononuclear cells. In one embodiment, the cells are exposed to a temperature from about 40-42 C. for 2-4 hours. In one embodiment, the temperature is 42-43 C. In another embodiment, the temperature is 42 C. for 2-3 hours. In another embodiment, the temperature is 43 C. for 2-3 hours. The cells can then be panned for CD34+ marker. This method can be used alone or in combination with other methods for Pgp+/CD34+ cell enrichment. For example, using a hyperthermic temperature during culturing, a population of cells can be enriched for Pgp+/CD34+ cells. In some embodiments, where cytotoxic agents are used , chemotherapeutics and/or photoactive dyes and/or other agents and/or physical stress such as hyperthermic treatment and/or nutritional/metabolic stress , serum- or growth factor starvation/depletion are used for isolating the Pgp+ cells from the sample the method can further include, after or prior to the above methods, exposing the sample to at least one primary antibody or antibody like moiety specific to p-glycoprotein. In some embodiments, the at least one primary antibody or antibody like moiety is conjugated to at least one fluorescent label or at least one magnetic label or biotin. In some embodiments, the methods further comprise optionally staining the sample with at least one secondary antibody. In some embodiments, the at least one secondary antibody is conjugated to at least one fluorescent label or at least one magnetic label or biotin. In some embodiments, isolating of the Pgp+ T cells from the sample is performed by any one or more methods selected from immunofluorescent methods, immunomagnetic methods, immunoaffinity methods or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, isolating of the Pgp+ T cells from the sample is performed by any one or more methods selected from flow cytometry, magnetic activated cell sorting, biotin-streptavidin based cell sorting or combinations thereof. Although not necessary, but using a combination of purification methods the enrichment of Pgp+ cells can be further improved and/or optimized. In some embodiments, the fraction enriched in Pgp+ T cells contains less than 50% Pgp T cells. In some embodiments, the fraction enriched in Pgp+ T cells contains less than 40% Pgp T cells.

In some embodiments, the fraction enriched in Pgp+ mononuclear cells contains less than 5% Pgp mononuclear cells. In some embodiments, the fraction enriched in Pgp+ mononuclear cells contains less than 1% Pgp mononuclear cells. In addition to Pgp, a number of other drug transporters including breast cancer resistance protein are selectively expressed on the surface of stem cells. Antibodies and substrates of these proteins can be also used to enrich lymphocytes with stem like phenotype for the purpose of adoptive cellular therapies. Thus, using selection techniques for these markers in combination with the selection techniques described herein for Pgp cell can improve cell-selection processing techniques. Once the Pgp expressing cells have been enriched by any of the above methods, the cells can be used for gene modification with CAR, TCR, chimeric TCR, synthetic immune receptor, TRuC T cell platform, Artemis T cell platform or other methods for the purpose of adoptive cellular therapy. They could be also used without gene modification, for example for immunization with T cell antigens.

In addition to enriching Pgp-expressing immune cells for the purpose of adoptive T cell therapies, the disclosure also teaches methods to deplete Pgp-expressing immune cells from stem cell grafts given to patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant to lower the risk of Graft versus Host disease. The disclosure also teaches methods to deplete Pgp-expressing immune cells from donor T cell given to immunodeficient patients to boost their immunity against infections while lowering the risk of Graft-vs-Host Disease GVHD. One of skill in the art would recognize that methods described herein for killing or ablation of Pgp cells i. e. , the selective killing of Pgp would not be useful for depleting a sample of Pgp+ cells. Rather methods that are capable of selectively killing or removing Pgp+ cells while leaving the Pgp cells intact would be used. Graft-versus-host disease GVHD is the main cause of mortality and a major limitation to the early and widespread use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation SCT, a treatment that often represents the only curative option for numerous patients with malignant diseases and hereditary metabolic disorders. Depletion of T cells capable of recognizing and mounting an immune response toward host cells from stem cell grafts can reduce or even eliminate GVHD. However, the elimination of T cells also results in delayed T-cell reconstitution and, thus, an increased rate of infection, particularly with viral agents such as cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster, and Epstein-Barr virus. In addition, the eradication of mature T cells is associated with an increased risk of graft rejection and an increased incidence of relapse of malignant disease. Thus, T cells are required early after allogeneic transplantation and depleting the graft of its T-cell content is not an ideal approach to prevention of complications after transplantation. Although new immunosuppressive agents offer options to decrease the incidence and severity of GVHD, most of the time these strategies are only partially effective and may also increase the incidence of viral and fungal infections and other adverse effects of profound immunosuppression. To provide a solution to this problem, selective inactivation or elimination of alloreactive donor T lymphocytes could allow early immune recovery and response toward infectious agents, and potentially preserve graft-versus-leukemia GVL activity. In addition, a strategy to selectively eliminate immunoreactive T cells could represent an important advance for the treatment of a large number of patients with autoimmune disorders. In this procedure, stimulation of T cells with mitogens or allogeneic major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cells resulted in the preferential retention of the TH9402 rhodamine-derivative in activated T cells, both CD4 and CD8. Photodynamic cell therapy of TH9402-exposed T cells led to the selective elimination of immunoreactive T-cell populations. Based on the discovery that Pgp is expressed on T stem cells and its expression is lost upon T cell activation, Pgp cells in a donor have been already exposed to an antigen. The likely antigens for such Pgp cells in a healthy donor are likely to be common pathogens, such as viruses and fungi. Thus, Pgp cells may confer immunity to pathogens commonly encountered in the environment. In contrast, Pgp+ cells are likely to contain nave cells that can cause GVHD when given to a donor. Therefore, elimination of Pgp+ cells from a graft may enrich for T cells that can confer immunity while sparing GVHD. In the present disclosure the method depletes Pgp-expressing T cells obtained from a donor. Thus, the present method involves depletion of Pgp+ cells. In contrast to other methods, the method of present disclosure does not involve stimulation of donor T cells with mitogen or MHC mismatched host cells. Finally, the method of the present disclosure involves depletion of Pgp expressing cells by staining with Pgp antibody or an antibody like moiety scFv, vHH, affibody, nanobody, Fab fragment, Darpins . In the method described herein, the depletion of Pgp expressing cells is achieved by staining T cells with more than 1 antibody or antibody like moieties directed against different epitopes on the extracellular domain of Pgp. Since Pgp is also expressed on normal hematopoietic stem cells, depletion of Pgp expressing cells would potentially deplete stem cells from the graft. As such, in one method of the disclosure, stem cells are first positively selected from the graft using an antibody against CD34 antigen. This can be achieved using a commercially available CD34 isolation system Miltenyi. Subsequently, the CD34-negative flow through fraction of the graft is depleted of Pgp expressing cells by immunostaining with Pgp antibody or a cocktail of antibodies. The CD34+ stem cell fraction is then administered with CD34/Pgp T cell fraction to the patient undergoing allogeneic bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cell, or umbilical cord stem cell transplant. The Pgp T cell fraction can also be given to the patient at a later time than CD34+ stem cell infusion. Another application of the disclosure is for adoptive cellular therapy in immunodeficient patients, such as allogeneic stem cell transplant including umbilical cord transplant recipients, who are immunodeficient and have become infected due to poor T cell reconstitution. Administration of a T cell population that is enriched for T cells capable of conferring immunity to viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens, but have limited capacity for alloreactivity or to cause GVHD, is highly desirable in this setting. Therefore, administration of Pgp T cell population obtained from the donor primary donor or even third party donors to such patients will protect against infectious agents while not significantly increasing the risk of GVHD. In one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for isolating Pgp T cells suitable for adoptive cell transfer therapy, comprising obtaining a sample, enriching the sample for T cells, and depleting Pgp+ T cells from the sample, so as to obtain a fraction enriched in Pgp T cells suitable for adoptive cell transfer therapy. In some embodiments, depleting the Pgp+ T cells from the sample comprises exposing the sample to at least one primary antibody or antibody like moiety specific to p-glycoprotein.

Typically, the compositions are administered by injection. Methods for these administrations are known to one skilled in the art. In another embodiment, the compositions can be part of a tissue delivery device or implant. In such embodiments, the cells are allowed to grow and/or exist in a biocompatible implantable structure , with in collagen matrix and the like. In another embodiment, the cells may be applied to a structure prior to implantation , a stent, balloon, valve, pump . The pharmaceutical compositions according to the disclosure can contain any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as used herein refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition, or vehicle that is involved in carrying or transporting a compound of interest from one tissue, organ, or portion of the body to another tissue, organ, or portion of the body. For example, the carrier may be a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent, or encapsulating material, or a combination thereof. Each component of the carrier must be pharmaceutically acceptable in that it must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation. It must also be suitable for use in contact with any tissues or organs with which it may come in contact, meaning that it must not carry a risk of toxicity, irritation, allergic response, immunogenicity, or any other complication that excessively outweighs its therapeutic benefits. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the disclosure can also be encapsulated or prepared in an emulsion or syrup for oral administration.

For additional guidance, see Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy Gennaro ed. 20th edition, Williams &amp; Wilkins PA, USA 2000. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises Pgp+ or Pgp cells at 1105 to 1108 cells/ml or any value there between which is expressly contemplated herein. The cells may be introduced directly into the peripheral blood or deposited within other locations throughout the body, , a desired tissue, or on microcarrier beads in the peritoneum. For example, 102 to 1011 cells can be transplanted in a single procedure, and additional transplants can be performed as required. Cells can be engineered using any of a variety of vectors including, but not limited to, integrating viral vectors, , retroviral vectors or lentiviral vectors or adeno-associated viral vectors; or non-integrating replicating vectors, , papilloma virus vectors, SV40 vectors, adenoviral vectors; or replication-defective viral vectors. Where transient expression is desired, non-integrating vectors and replication defective vectors may be used, since either inducible or constitutive promoters can be used in these systems to control expression of the gene of interest. Where the vector is a non-integrating vector, such vectors can be lost from cells by dilution, as desired. An example of a non-integrating vector includes Epstein-Barr virus EBV vector. Alternatively, integrating vectors can be used to obtain transient expression, provided the gene of interest is controlled by an inducible promoter. Other methods of introducing DNA into cells include the use of liposomes, lipofection, electroporation, a particle gun, or by direct DNA injection. Alternatively, cells can be engineered using transfection of in vitro transcribed mRNA. Conventional recombinant DNA techniques can be used in the methods of the disclosure. For example, conventional recombinant DNA techniques are used to introduce a desired polynucleotide into cells , polynucleotides encoding a CAR. The precise method used to introduce a polynucleotide is not critical to the disclosure. For example, physical methods for the introduction of polynucleotides into cells include microinjection and electroporation or viral gene therapy. Chemical methods such as coprecipitation with calcium phosphate and incorporation of polynucleotides into liposomes are also standard methods of introducing polynucleotides into mammalian cells. For example, DNA or RNA can be introduced using standard vectors, such as those derived from murine and avian retroviruses see, , Gluzman et al. , 1988, Viral Vectors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y. or lentiviral vector systems. Standard recombinant molecular biology methods are well known in the art see, , Ausubel et al. , 1989, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, and viral vectors for gene therapy have been developed and successfully used clinically Rosenberg, et al. , 1990, N. Engl. J. Med, 323:370. Other methods, such as naked polynucleotide uptake from a matrix coated with DNA are also encompassed by the disclosure see, for example, 5,962,427, which is incorporated herein by reference. Any promoter may be used to drive the expression of the inserted gene. For example, viral promoters include but are not limited to the CMV promoter/enhancer, SV40, papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, elastin gene promoter and beta-globin. If transient expression is desired, constitutive promoters are used in a non-integrating and/or replication-defective vector. Alternatively, inducible promoters could be used to drive the expression of the inserted gene when necessary. Inducible promoters can be built into integrating and/or replicating vectors. For example, inducible promoters include, but are not limited to, metallothionien and heat shock protein. The lymphocytes or progenitor lymphocytes of the disclosure can be isolated from a sample obtained from a mammalian subject. The subject can be any mammal , bovine, ovine, porcine, canine, feline, equine, primate, including a human. The sample of cells may be obtained from any of a number of different sources including, for example, bone marrow, fetal tissue , fetal liver tissue, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, healthy or diseased tissue , tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the like. Although the disclosure has exemplified in various embodiments Pgp+ and Pgp T cells, the methods and compositions of the disclosure are applicable to NK cells, Pgp+ hematopietic stem cells , CD34+/Pgp+ hematopoietic stem cells and the like. Thus, in any of the various embodiments describe herein and throughout the specification the term T cell can be replaced with NK cell or CD34+ cell etc. One of skill in the art will recognize that CD34+ cells are stem cells and thus have additional methods and compositions applications that extend beyond T cell. For example, CD34+ cells can be isolated/purified using metabolic starvation, hyperthermia and/or chemotoxic compounds and used for allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation with or without genetic modifications to the cells. In another embodiment, the disclosure provides methods of establishing and/or maintaining populations of cells, or the progeny thereof, as well as mixed populations comprising various cells types as well as subpopulations , Pgp+ and/or Pgp. Once a culture of cells or a mixed culture of cells and/or progenitor cell stem-like cells is established, the population of cells is maintained and/or mitotically expanded in vitro by passage to fresh medium as cell density dictates under conditions conducive to cell proliferation and maintenance. Once cells or desired sub-population of cells of the disclosure have been established in culture, as described above, they may be maintained or stored in cell banks comprising either continuous in vitro cultures of cells requiring regular transfer or cells which have been cryopreserved. Cryopreservation of cells of the disclosure may be carried out according to known methods, such as those described in Doyle et al. , eds. , 1995, Cell &amp; Tissue Culture: Laboratory Procedures, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester. For example, but not by way of limitation, cells may be suspended in a freeze medium such as, for example, culture medium further comprising 15-20% fetal bovine serum FBS and 10% dimethylsulfoxide DMSO, with or without 5-10% glycerol, at a density, for example, of about 4-10106 cells/ml. The cells are dispensed into glass or plastic vials which are then sealed and transferred to a freezing chamber of a programmable or passive freezer. The optimal rate of freezing may be determined empirically. For example, a freezing program that gives a change in temperature of 1 C. /min through the heat of fusion may be used. Once vials containing the cells have reached 80 C. , they are transferred to a liquid nitrogen storage area. Cryopreserved cells can be stored for a period of years, though they should be checked at least every 5 years for maintenance of viability. The cryopreserved cells of the disclosure constitute a bank of cells, portions of which can be withdrawn by thawing and then used to produce a cell culture as needed. Thawing should generally be carried out rapidly, for example, by transferring a vial from liquid nitrogen to a 37 C. water bath. The thawed contents of the vial should be immediately transferred under sterile conditions to a culture vessel containing an appropriate medium. It is advisable that the cells in the culture medium be adjusted to an initial density of about 1-3105 cells/ml. Once in culture, the cells may be examined daily, for example, with an inverted microscope to detect cell proliferation, and subcultured, if appropriate, as soon as they reach an appropriate density. In another embodiment, the disclosure provides cell lines of Pgp+ cells. As used herein a cell line means a culture of cells of the disclosure, or progeny cells thereof, that can be reproduced for an extended period of time, preferably indefinitely, and which term includes, for example, cells that are cultured, cryopreserved and re-cultured following cryopreservation. As used herein a culture means a population of cells grown in a medium and optionally passaged accordingly.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "The disclosure relates to a culture module, a culture system and a culture method and more particularly, to a cell culture module, a cell culture system and a cell culture method.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Current carrier scaffolds for cell mass production may be divided into two categories, one being natural materials such as collagen, chitosan, gelatin or the like and the other being synthetic materials such as polycaprolactone PCL, polystyrene PS, polypropylene PP, polylactic-co-glycolic acid PLGA or the like. The natural materials are mostly materials derived from animal sources. Although the materials derived from animal sources have lower cytotoxicity and higher biocompatibility, they may carry undetectable animal contaminants. Therefore, the current trend is toward reducing or even eliminating the use of the materials derived from animal sources to reduce the risk of contamination. In addition, among current commercially available cell carriers, all the synthetic materials except for alginate-based related products are difficult to degrade, thus causing challenges in collecting the cells. Since the alginate-based related products require a high concentration of calcium ions during cell culture, the cells may be damaged or a tendency to differentiation may be induced in some certain cells , mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, during degradation of alginate, it is necessary to use a calcium ion chelator and improper usage thereof is very likely to cause damage to the cells. In addition, there is still room for improvement in key techniques for cell collection carrier scaffolds. Thus, current cell mass production technology still remains at a conventional two-dimensional flat plate culture method and the process cannot be adapted to larger scale production. Therefore, to find a carrier material suitable for rapid and mass growth of cells and yet devoid of animal contaminants and to enhance cell recovery rate and cell quality are both issues that researchers are eager to solve.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "The disclosure is more comprehensively described with reference to the figures of the present embodiments. However, the disclosure may also be implemented in various different forms and is not limited to the embodiments in the present specification. The same or similar reference numerals in the figures represent the same or similar elements and are not repeated in the following paragraphs. 1A and 1B are respectively schematic views of cell culture carriers of a cell culture module in a twisted state and an untwisted state according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring to 1A and 1B, a cell culture module 100A of the present embodiment includes a reactor 110, a first fixer 120, a second fixer 130A and a plurality of cell culture carriers 140. The reactor 110 has a chamber C10 and at least one inlet/outlet T12. The chamber C10 is configured to provide space for culturing cells. The inlet/outlet T12 communicates with the chamber C10. The first fixer 120 is fixed to the reactor 110 and located in the chamber C10. The second fixer 130A is disposed in the chamber C10 and is movable relative to the first fixer 120. Two ends of the cell culture carriers 140 are respectively fixed to the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130A. The cell culture carriers 140 are in the twisted state as shown in 1A, or the cell culture carriers 140 are in the untwisted state as shown in 1B according to a variation in a distance between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130A due to a movement of the second fixer 130A. In other words, when the distance between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130A becomes less than a stretch length of the cell culture carriers 140 due to the movement of the second fixer 130A, the cell culture carriers 140 are in the twisted state, as shown in 1A. The cell culture carriers 140 may have a strip shape. The strip-shaped cell culture carriers 140 may be used in limited space to obtain more area for cells to adhere to so as to increase the number of culturable cells. In addition, when the distance between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130A becomes roughly equal to the stretch length of the cell culture carriers 140 due to the movement of the second fixer 130A, the cell culture carriers 140 are rendered in the untwisted state, as shown in 1B. In this state, the cells may be detached from the cell culture carriers 140 during a change of state of the cell culture carriers 140 from the twisted state to the untwisted state by the action of a substance such as an enzyme which may detach the cells from the cell culture carriers 140. Further, since the distance between the cell culture carriers 140 is increased, an enzyme or the like may act on cells inside the cell culture carriers 140 which are previously difficult to be acted upon by the enzyme, which conduces to enhancement of a cell recovery rate. In the present embodiment, since the second fixer 130A is movably disposed in the chamber C10, when the reactor 110 is placed in the state of 1A, the second fixer 130A moves downward to a position close to the first fixer 120 due to its own gravity. To change the cell culture carriers 140 to the untwisted state, the reactor 110 may be placed upside down as shown in 1B and changed to a state opposite the state in 1A. In this way, the second fixer 130A moves downward to a position away from the first fixer 120 due to its own gravity, and the cell culture carriers 140 are stretched by the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130A and changed to the untwisted state. In addition, to improve mobility of the second fixer 130A, a weight block may be installed onto the second fixer 130A to ensure that the second fixer 130A may move by its own gravity. From another point of view, when the cell culture carriers 140 are in the untwisted state, each of the cell culture carriers 140 is equivalent to a two-dimensional structure. When the cell culture carriers 140 are in the twisted state, the interleaved cell culture carriers 140 are equivalent to a three-dimensional structure. In 1A, each of the cell culture carriers 140 in the twisted state has a regular spiral shape. However, the cell culture carrier 140 may also be randomly twisted, and thus a plurality of cell culture carriers 140 in the twisted state may have a coiling shape. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto. In 1B, each of the cell culture carriers 140 in the untwisted state has a straight strip shape, and thus a plurality of cell culture carriers 140 in the untwisted state may be arranged in an array of parallel lines. However, the cell culture carriers 140 in the untwisted state may not be parallel to one another, or some of the cell culture carriers 140 may be slightly bent. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto. A material of the cell culture carriers 140 includes, for example, polyester PET, nylon, polyethylene PE, polypropylene PP, polyvinyl chloride PVC, polystyrene PS, polycarbonate PC, ethylene vinyl acetate EVA, polyurethane PU or the like. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto, and any material having fiber drawing properties may be used as the material for the cell culture carrier of the disclosure. In addition, each of the cell culture carriers 140 may be in the shape of a striped sheet, a threadlike sheet, or in any other suitable shape. The cell culture carriers 140 may be a material to which cells may adhere or a material having cell adhesion properties after processing. The above processing methods include surface modification, surface coating, surface microstructurization or the like. Surface modification is achieved by, for example, performing plasma modification on a surface of the material to which cells may adhere, or a surface of a material to which cells cannot adhere to impart the cell adhesion properties to the surface, thereby facilitating adhesion of the cells. Surface coating includes coating, for example but not limited to, collagen, chitosan, gelatin, alginate or the like, onto the surface of the material to which cells may adhere or the surface of the material to which cells cannot adhere, thereby facilitating adhesion of the cells. Surface microstructurization is achieved by, for example, performing laser cutting on the surface of the material to which cells may adhere or the surface of the material to which cells cannot adhere so as to form microchannels, thereby facilitating adhesion of the cells. However, the processing methods of the disclosure are not limited thereto, and any processing method capable of enhancing cell adhesion properties may be applied in the disclosure. A material of the reactor 110, the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130A includes, for example, polyester PET, nylon, polyethylene PE, polypropylene PP, polyvinyl chloride PVC, polystyrene PS, ethylene vinyl acetate EVA, polyurethane PU, polycarbonate PC, glass or the like. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto. In one exemplary embodiment, the inlet/outlet T12 of the cell culture module 100A may be disposed on one end portion of the reactor 110. When only one single inlet/outlet T12 is disposed in the cell culture module 100A, the inlet/outlet T12 may be used both for entry and exit of a liquid such as a culture medium and a buffer solution and for cell collection. However, in other exemplary embodiments, the entry and exit of the culture medium and the buffer solution and the cell collection may respectively use different channels, in view of preventing the whole module from contamination. In detail, the cell culture module 100A of the present embodiment may include a plurality of inlets/outlets T12, T14, T16, T18 not illustrated, T21 and T23, wherein the inlet/outlet T12 is disposed on one end portion of the reactor 110 and enables the cell collection. The inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18 may be disposed on a side surface of the reactor 110 and close to the end portion of the reactor 110 on which the inlet/outlet T12 is disposed, so as to allow entry of different buffer solutions and culture media into the reactor 110. It should be noted that the numbers of the inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18 may vary depending on the type and requirements of the actually injected liquid, and are not limited to those mentioned herein. The inlets/outlets T21 and T23 are disposed on the other end portion of the reactor 110, opposite the inlet/outlet T12. The inlet/outlet T21 allows the entry and exit of liquid such as a culture medium or a buffer solution, and the inlet/outlet T23 is a reserved hole, wherein the design in which the inlet/outlet T21 is located opposite the inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18 facilitates distribution and circulation of liquid within the chamber C10. The cell culture module 100A of the present embodiment may further include a turbulent part 150 disposed in the chamber C10 and between the inlet/outlet T12 and the first fixer 120. To be specific, the turbulent part 150 may be arranged at the same plane height as the inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18. The liquid that enters via the inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18, after being rotated by the turbulent part 150, may drive circulation of the liquid in the chamber C10. As a result, substances in the liquid in the chamber C10 may be uniformly distributed. The cell culture module may have different designs depending on whether it is reusable. When the cell culture module is reusable, as shown in the present embodiment, the reactor 110 of the cell culture module 100A further includes a body 112 and a cover 114, the body 112 and the cover 114 being connected with each other to form the chamber C10. By opening the cover 114, the communication with the chamber C10 becomes possible so that the cell culture carriers 140 may be replaced. In addition, a sealing part 116 may further be disposed between the body 112 and the cover 114 to maintain sealability of the chamber C10. When the cell culture module is for one time use only, the reactor 110 is integrally formed. 2A and 2B are schematic views of a cell culture carrier of a cell culture module, in the untwisted state and the twisted state, respectively, according to another exemplary embodiment. Referring to 2A and 2B, a cell culture module 100B of the present embodiment is similar to the cell culture module 100A of 1A. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the cell culture module 100B of the present embodiment further includes a magnetic control part 160A. Correspondingly, a second fixer 130B of the present embodiment has magnetism. Accordingly, the magnetic control part 160A may control the second fixer 130B to move, using magnetic force such as magnetic attractive force or magnetic repulsive force. As shown in 2A, when the magnetic control part 160A magnetically controls the second fixer 130B to move to a position away from the first fixer 120, the cell culture carriers 140 are rendered in the untwisted state. As shown in 2B, when the magnetic control part 160A controls the second fixer 130B to move to a position close to the first fixer 120, the cell culture carriers 140 are rendered in the twisted state. The shape of the magnetic control part 160A of the present embodiment roughly matches the shape of the reactor 110. Moreover, the magnetic control part 160A itself is movable, thereby driving the second fixer 130B to move. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto. 3 is a schematic view of a cell culture module according to still another exemplary embodiment. Referring to 3, a cell culture module 100C of the present embodiment is similar to the cell culture module 100B of 2A. Nonetheless, it should be noted that, when a magnetic control part 160B of the present embodiment intends to control the second fixer 130B to move, the magnetic control part 160B directly moves to one side of the reactor 110 away from the first fixer 120 and then uses magnetic force to attract the second fixer 130B to move to a position away from the first fixer 120. By contrast, after the magnetic control part 160B is removed, the second fixer 130B will move to a position close to the first fixer 120 due to its own gravity. 4A and 4B are schematic views of a cell culture carrier of a cell culture module, in the twisted state and the untwisted state, respectively, according to yet still another exemplary embodiment. Referring to 4A and 4B, a cell culture module 100D of the present embodiment is similar to the cell culture module 100A of 1A. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the cell culture module 100D of the present embodiment further includes a fastener 170. In addition, a reactor 110A further includes an elastic corrugated structure 110A1. When no force is applied thereto, the elastic corrugated structure 110A1 is, for example, in a stretched state as shown in 4B. The fastener 170 is configured to control the elastic corrugated structure 110A1 to remain in a compressed state or not, so that the elastic corrugated structure 110A1 may switch between the stretched state as shown in 4B and the compressed state as shown in 4A. A second fixer 130C of the present embodiment is fixed to the reactor 110A, and the elastic corrugated structure 110A1 is located between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130C. When the fastener 170 is fastened, the elastic corrugated structure 110A1 is in the compressed state. Thus, the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130C approach each other to render the cell culture carriers 140 in the twisted state. When the fastener 170 is released, the elastic corrugated structure 110A1 is in the stretched state. Thus, the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130C are away from each other to render the cell culture carriers 140 in the untwisted state. It should be noted that although the fastener 170 is taken as an example in the present embodiment, the fastener 170 may also be arbitrarily replaced with other fixers, such as a velcro, a screw, a rope and the like. 5 is a schematic view of a cell culture module according to further still another exemplary embodiment. Referring to 5, a cell culture module 100E of the present embodiment is similar to the cell culture module 100A of 1A. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the cell culture module 100E of the present embodiment further includes a rod 180 and a guide hole 182. The guide hole 182 is disposed on one end of a reactor 110B, opposite the first fixer 120, so as to guide the rod 180 to be movably inserted through the reactor 110B. The rod 180 is connected to the second fixer 130A and configured to control the second fixer 130A to move. By controlling the extent to which the rod 180 is inserted into the reactor 110B, it is possible to control the second fixer 130A to move to a position close to or away from the first fixer 120. 6 is a schematic view of a cell culture module according to another exemplary embodiment. Referring to 6, a cell culture module 100F of the present embodiment is similar to the cell culture module 100A of 1A. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the cell culture module 100F of the present embodiment further includes a fluid pressure control part 190 disposed in the reactor 110 and inside the chamber C10. The second fixer 130A is located between the fluid pressure control part 190 and the first fixer 120. The fluid pressure control part 190 is configured to control the second fixer 130A to move. For example, the fluid pressure control part 190 is applicable to bags for containing fluids. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto. As a gas, water, oil or other fluid contained in the fluid pressure control part 190 increases, the volume of the fluid pressure control part 190 also increases, thus pushing the second fixer 130A to move in a direction approaching the first fixer 120. As the gas, water, oil or other fluid contained in the fluid pressure control part 190 decreases, the volume of the fluid pressure control part 190 also decreases, thus allowing the second fixer 130A to move in a direction away from the first fixer 120. 7 is a schematic view of a cell culture module according to still another exemplary embodiment. Referring to 7, a cell culture module 100G of the present embodiment is similar to the cell culture module 100A of 1A. Nonetheless, it should be noted that, in the cell culture module 100G of the present embodiment, a second fixer 130D is screwed onto a wall of a reactor 110C. In other words, screw threads matching each other are provided on contact surfaces of both the second fixer 130D and the reactor 110C. Accordingly, when the second fixer 130D is rotated relative to the reactor 110C, the second fixer 130D approaches or departs from the first fixer 120. A knob 130D1 is further provided on the second fixer 130D of the present embodiment to enable a user to easily apply force to rotate the second fixer 130D. 8A to 8F are schematic views illustrating several stages of a cell culture performed by a cell culture system according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring first to 8A, a cell culture system 1000 of the present embodiment includes a cell tank 200, a culture medium module 300 and a cell culture module 400. The cell tank 200 and the culture medium module 300 respectively communicate with the cell culture module 400. The cell culture module 400 may be any cell culture module of the aforesaid embodiments or any other cell culture module complying with the spirit of the disclosure. The details of the cell culture module 400 are omitted herein. Since the cell culture system 1000 of the present embodiment uses the cell culture module 400 that is the same as the cell culture module of the aforesaid embodiments, the cell culture system 1000 of the present embodiment may enhance the yield and the recovery rate of cell culture. In addition, the cell culture system 1000 of the present embodiment may optionally further include a pump 500, a cleaning solution tank 600 and a cell detachment enzyme tank 700. The cell tank 200 and the culture medium module 300 respectively communicate with the cell culture module 400 via the pump 500. Both the cleaning solution tank 600 and the cell detachment enzyme tank 700 also communicate with the cell culture module 400 via, for example, the pump 500. In the present embodiment, the cell tank 200, the culture medium module 300, the cleaning solution tank 600 and the cell detachment enzyme tank 700 all communicate with the cell culture module 400 via the pump 500. The cell tank 200 is connected to the pump 500 by which the cell tank 200 is connected to the inlet/outlet T12 of the cell culture module 400. The cleaning solution tank 600 is connected to the pump 500 by which the cleaning solution tank 600 is connected to the inlet/outlet T14 of the cell culture module 400. The cell detachment enzyme tank 700 is connected to the pump 500 by which the cell detachment enzyme tank 700 is connected to the inlet/outlet T16 of the cell culture module 400. The culture medium module 300 is connected to the pump 500 by which the culture medium module 300 is connected to the inlet/outlet T18 of the cell culture module 400. The culture medium of the culture medium module 300 enters the cell culture module 400 via the inlet/outlet T18, and then flows back from the cell culture module 400 to the culture medium module 300 via the inlet/outlet T21 on the other end. Therefore, the culture medium of the culture medium module 300 may be recycled for use. To monitor quality of the culture medium of the culture medium module 300, a culture medium tank 310 of the culture medium module 300 is equipped with a culture medium sensor 314. The culture medium sensor 314 is, for example, a pH meter, a thermometer, or a dissolved oxygen meter. In addition, a stirring bar 312 is further disposed in the culture medium tank 310 to maintain uniform distribution of culture substances in the culture medium. In addition, the culture medium module 300 is further equipped with a pump 320 and a regulator 330. When the culture medium sensor 314 senses that the quality of the culture medium in the culture medium tank 310 is lower than a threshold value, the pump 320 extracts regulating substances from the regulator 330 into the culture medium tank 310 so as to improve the quality of the culture medium. A cell culture system 1000 of the present embodiment may further include a controller 800. The controller 800 is connected to the cell tank 200, the cleaning solution tank 600, the cell detachment enzyme tank 700, the cell culture module 400 and the culture medium module 300 respectively via the pump 500, the culture medium sensor 314 and the pump 320 to control the pump 500, the pump 320, the regulator 330 and the culture medium sensor 314. In addition, the cell culture system 1000 of the present embodiment may further include a regulator 900 installed onto the cell culture module 400, for regulating the substances in the cell culture module 400 when necessary. 9 is a flowchart of a cell culture method that may be performed by a cell culture system and a cell culture module according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring to 8A and 9, during a cell culture process, first of all, the cell culture carrier 140 of the cell culture module 400 is rendered in the twisted state, and arrangement of pipelines of the system is completed step S110. As mentioned in the aforesaid embodiments, a method of rendering the cell culture carrier 140 of the cell culture module 400 in the twisted state includes causing the second fixer 130A to move to a position close to the first fixer 120. However, the way of performing the method is not limited. As in the aforesaid embodiments, the second fixer 130A may be displaced through gravity, magnetic force, or other mechanical force. In the present embodiment, the movement of the second fixer 130A may be controlled with the assistance of the magnetic control part 160A, but is not limited thereto. Referring to 8A and 9, next, cells in the cell tank 200 which are to be cultured are sent to the cell culture module 400 using the pump 500, so as to inoculate the cells to be cultured onto the cell culture carrier 140 in the twisted state step S120. The cells to be cultured are, for example but not limited to, stem cells or differentiated cells. Specifically, the cells to be cultured are, for example but not limited to, African green monkey kidney cell line Vero, human adipose-derived stem cells ADSCs, mesenchymal stem cells MSCs, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney MDCK cells, human embryonic kidney cells 293 HEK 293 cells or the like. In the present embodiment, a culture medium is first added to the cell culture carrier 140, and the cells are then inoculated to the cell culture carrier 140. In another exemplary embodiment, a cell culture medium containing the cells may be uniformly added directly to the cell culture carrier 140. The culture medium is a standard growth culture medium commonly used for cell culture, and examples thereof include a culture medium having fetal bovine serum FBS or a serum-free medium. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto. In addition, it should be understood that, depending on different cell properties, requirements of operating concentration of the cell culture medium is different. Hence, the operating concentration may be adjusted according to cell properties, and growth factors, antibiotics or the like may be added to the culture medium if needed. The cells are caused to adhere to the cell culture carrier. In the present embodiment, the cell culture carrier 140 is placed in the cell culture module 400 under specific growth conditions , specific temperature, humidity, or carbon dioxide concentration such that the cells adhere to the cell culture carrier 140. In other exemplary embodiments, each pipeline of the system may also be configured first when the cell culture carriers 140 are in the untwisted state and then the cell culture carriers 140 in the untwisted state are inoculated. When the cells are attached, the twisting action of the cell culture carriers 140 is performed, but the disclosure is not limited to the above. Referring to 8B and 9, next, after the cell adhesion, a culture medium is perfused and circulated to start the cell culture step S130. That is, after the aforesaid steps are completed, the pump 500 may be turned on to allow the culture medium of the culture medium module 300 to flow into the cell culture module 400, and the culture medium is continuously circulated between the culture medium module 300 and the cell culture module 400 so as to culture the cells. The cell culture is performed by, for example, static culture or dynamic culture. The dynamic culture may be performed by disturbing the culture medium surrounding the cell culture carrier. A method of disturbing the culture medium includes, for example, using the turbulent part 150 as in 1A, which is but not illustrated in the present embodiment. In one exemplary embodiment, the number of cells after culture may increase to 100 times or more the original number of cells. In another exemplary embodiment, the number of cells after culture may increase to 2000 times or more the original number of cells. It is noting that since different cells have different properties, the cell culture conditions may be adjusted based on different cell types. For example, when culturing mammalian cells, the cells may be cultured at conditions of 37 C. and 5% of CO2, and the pH value of the culture medium is maintained within a physiological range thereof. For example, for most animal cells, a suitable pH value of the culture medium is 7. 2 to 7. 4. Referring to 8C and 9, next, the culture medium is discharged and a cleaning solution is perfused, and the remaining culture medium is removed by immersion and cleaning in the cleaning solution step S140. That is, all of the culture medium in the cell culture module 400 is sent back to the culture medium module 300. Then, the cleaning solution in the cleaning solution tank 600 is caused to flow into the cell culture module 400 by the pump 500, and the remaining culture medium is removed by immersion and cleaning in the cleaning solution. The cleaning solution is, for example, a phosphate buffered saline solution. Referring to 8D and 9, next, a cell detachment enzyme is perfused to immerse the cell culture carrier and the cells therein step S150. That is, all of the cleaning solution in the cell culture module 400 is sent back to the cleaning solution tank 600. Then, the cell detachment enzyme in the cell detachment enzyme tank 700 is caused to flow into the cell culture module 400 by the pump 500, and the cell culture carrier 140 in the twisted state and the cells are immersed in the cell detachment enzyme. The cell detachment enzyme is, for example, trypsin, tryp LE, accutase, accumax, or collagenase. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto, and other enzymes or reagents capable of cell detachment may also be used. Referring to 8E and 9, next, the cell culture carrier is loosened and transformed into a two-dimensional structure, causing detachment of the cells step S160. That is, the cell culture carrier 140 of the cell culture module 400 is changed from the twisted state to the untwisted state. As mentioned in the aforesaid embodiments, a method of rendering the cell culture carrier 140 of the cell culture module 400 in the untwisted state includes causing the second fixer 130A to move to a position away from the first fixer 120. In the present embodiment, the movement may be performed with the assistance of the magnetic control part 160A. Referring to 8F and 9, next, a cell suspension is collected step S170. That is, a cell suspension in the cell culture module 400 is sent to the cell tank 200 through the pump 500. Since the cell recovery is performed when the cell culture carrier 140 is in the untwisted state, the loosened structure allows the cell culture carrier 140 to sufficiently react with a reagent containing the cell detachment enzyme, and the loosened structure also facilitates the detachment of the cells on an inner layer of the cell culture carrier 140, thereby enhancing the cell recovery rate. It should be noted that, in the aforesaid embodiments, the cell culture carrier 140 is loosened after the cell detachment enzyme is perfused, and the cells are then collected. However, in other exemplary embodiments, the cell culture carrier 140 may first be loosened to return to the two-dimensional state. The cell detachment enzyme is then perfused to collect the cultured cells. The disclosure is not limited to the above description. In the above embodiments, the reactor of the cell culture module is cylindrical, but is not limited thereto. In other exemplary embodiments, the cell culture module may also be designed with other shapes as desired. It should be noted that in order to match the cell culture modules of different shapes, the cell culture carriers are also adaptable to different laying methods. 10A and 10B are respectively schematic views of a sheet-shaped carrier member of a cell culture module in an open state and a folded state according to another exemplary embodiment. Referring to 10A and 10B, a cell culture module 100H of the present embodiment includes a casing 111, a first fixer 120, a second fixer 130 and a sheet-shaped carrier member 14. The casing 111 has a chamber C10 and at least one inlet/outlet T12, wherein the at least one inlet/outlet T12 communicates with the chamber C10. The first fixer 120 is fixed to the casing 111 and located in the chamber C10. The second fixer 130 is disposed in the chamber C10 and is movable relative to the first fixer 120. The sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is formed by arranging a plurality of cell culture carriers 140 and two opposite ends of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 are respectively fixed to the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130. The sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the open state as shown in 10A, or the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the folded state as shown in 10B according to a variation in a distance between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130 due to a movement of the second fixer 130. In the present embodiment, the casing 111 is a six-sided box-shaped shape, such as a flat plate shape, but is not limited thereto. When a plurality of cell culture modules 100H are used, a plurality of casings 111 may be stacked with each other to more effectively utilize the entire space. Further, the cell culture carriers 140 are designed to be arranged in the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 with a variation in the shape of the casing 111, so that the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 may be covered on one surface of the flat plate-shaped casing 111 when the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the open state. The straight strip cell culture carriers 140 may specifically be a single-line, double-line, or yarn structure and the line may be configured as a straight line, a curve, a spiral curve, a wavy curve, a zigzag curve, an inverted curve, or a sheet curve, etc. , but is not limited to the above. The plurality of straight strip cell culture carriers 140 are arranged to form the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 and the cell culture carriers 140 may be arranged in a parallel arrangement or an interleaved arrangement and the arranged sheet-shaped carrier member 14 may be single-layered or multi-layered, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In the present embodiment, a plurality of cell culture carriers 140 are arranged in a single layer in parallel to form the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 and the cell culture carriers 140 are respectively fixed to the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130 at two opposite ends of the axial extending direction thereof. Therefore, when the distance between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130A becomes less than a stretch length of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 or the cell culture carriers 140 due to the movement of the second fixer 130, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 or the cell culture carriers 140 is rendered in the folded state as shown in 10B. In this state, a plurality of cell culture carriers 140 may be used in limited space to obtain more area for cells to adhere to so as to increase the number of culturable cells. When the distance between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130 becomes roughly equal to the stretch length of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 or the cell culture carriers 140 due to the movement of the second fixer 130, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 or the cell culture carriers 140 is rendered in the open state as shown in 10A. The cells may be detached from the cell culture carriers 140 during a change of state of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 from the folded state to the open state. Further, since the distance between the cell culture carriers 140 is increased, a substance such as an enzyme for facilitating detachment of the cells from the cell culture carriers 140 may be injected, and the substance may easily reach all the cells to sufficiently perform a reaction, which conduces to enhancement of a cell recovery rate. Please refer to 11. In another exemplary embodiment, a plurality of cell culture carriers 140 are arranged in a single layer in parallel to form the sheet-shaped carrier member 14, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 further include a first connecting portion 142 and a second connecting portion 144, and the cell culture carriers 140 are respectively fixed to the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144 at two opposite ends of the axial extending direction thereof. The first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144 are adjacently connected to the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130. In detail, the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144 are two long sides of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14, and the sides in the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 fixed to the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130 are two short sides in the sheet-shaped carrier member 14. That is, the first connecting portion 142, the second connecting portion 144, the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130 are all located on different sides of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14. Further, in the embodiments of 1A to 10B, a moving direction D of the second fixer is roughly parallel to the axial extending direction of the cell culture carriers 140, but in the embodiment of 11, the movement direction D of the second fixer 130 is roughly perpendicular to the axial extending direction of the cell culture carriers 140 in the sheet-shaped carrier member 14. In other exemplary embodiments, the moving direction D of the second fixer 130 is roughly at an angle to the axial extending direction of the cell culture carriers 140 in the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 and is not limited thereto. Refer to all of 11, 12A and 12B. It is noted that, in order to simplify the illustration, the cell culture carriers 140 are not illustrated in 12A and 12B, but it should be understood from the above description that the configuration of the cell culture carriers 140 may include making the axial extending direction of the cell culture carriers 140 perpendicular, angled, or parallel to the moving direction D of the second fixer 130. In the embodiment of 11, when the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the open state, the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144 are roughly straight lines or slightly curved, but in the different embodiments of 12A and 12B, the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144 may be designed to have a zigzag or wavy shape via molding, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. The uneven shape of the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144, such as a zigzag or a wave shape, may guide the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 to be uniformly folded and compressed when the second fixer 130 is moved toward the first fixer 120, so that when the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the folded state, a suitable space exists between the plurality of cell culture carriers 140 to prevent a portion of the region between the plurality of cell culture carriers 140 from being too dense due to uneven extrusion, resulting in adverse cell growth. As shown in 12A and 12B, the sheet-shaped carrier members 14 in a cell culture module 100J further include a third connecting portion 146. The third connecting portion 146 is disposed between the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144, such that one end of the cell culture carriers 140 is fixed to the first connecting portion 142 and the other end of the cell culture carriers 140 is extended to the third connecting portion 146 and then extended to the second connection 144 via the third connecting portion 146. The third connecting portion 146 not only has the same shaping function as the folding guide of the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144, when the distance between the first connecting portion 142 and the second connecting portion 144 is longer, the configuration of the third connecting portion 146 may also provide a fixed support function to prevent the cell culture carriers 140 from sagging due to the excessive distance between the two ends. In particular, the number of the third connecting portion 146 may not be limited to one. In one exemplary embodiment, the casing 111 has a tapered portion 113 and at least one inlet/outlet T12 is disposed at the tapered portion 113. The tapered portion 113 is gradually narrowed outward from the casing 111 to form, for example, a funnel-shaped structure and the tapered portion 113 allows a cell collection fluid to easily flow out during cell collection, thereby reducing cell residue and allowing the gas remaining in the chamber C10 to be easily discharged. Of course, the tapered portion 113 may also effectively collect the fluid entering the chamber C10 to facilitate discharge. In one exemplary embodiment, when only one single inlet/outlet T12 is disposed in the cell culture module, the inlet/outlet T12 may be used both for entry and exit of a liquid such as a culture medium and a buffer solution and for cell collection. However, in other exemplary embodiments, the entry and exit of the culture medium and the buffer solution and the cell collection may respectively use different channels, in view of preventing the whole module from contamination. In detail, the cell culture modules 100H to 100J of the present embodiment may include a plurality of inlets/outlets T12, T14, T16 and T18, wherein the inlet/outlet T12 is disposed at the tapered portion 113 and the collection of cells may be performed via the configuration of the inlet/outlet T12. The inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18 may be disposed at the other side of the casing 111 opposite to the tapered portion 113 to respectively allow entry of different buffer solutions and culture media. It should be noted that the number of the inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18 may be varied according to the actual type of liquid injected and is not limited to the above. In particular, the design of the relative positions of the inlet/outlet T12 and the inlets/outlets T14, T16 and T18 facilitates the distribution and flow circulation of the fluid in the chamber C10. Moreover, the cell culture modules 100H, 100I and 100J may have different designs depending on whether they are reusable. When the cell culture modules 100H, 100I and 100J are reusable, the casing 111 may be designed as two separable components, that is, the casing 111 further includes a body 112 and a cover 114, or may be further provided with a sealing member 116 112, 114 and 116 are not shown in the figure, it may refer to 1A and the functions and objects thereof are the same as those described above and are not repeated herein. When the cell culture modules 100H, 100I and 100J are for one time use only, the casing 111 is integrally formed and a two-piece design is unnecessary. In addition, in the embodiments of the cell culture modules 100H, 100I and 100J, as in the aforesaid embodiments, the second fixer 130 may be may be displaced through gravity, magnetic force, or other mechanical force, thereby changing the state of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14. In detail, when gravity is configured to displace the second fixer 130, since the second fixer 130 is movably disposed in the chamber C10, when the casing 111 is placed upright, the second fixer 130 moves downward to a position close to the first fixer 120 due to its own gravity. When the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is to be transformed into the open state, the casing 111 may be raised toward the other corresponding direction, so that the second fixer 130 moves downward to a position away from the first fixer 120 due to its own gravity and the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is stretched by the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130 and changed to the open state. In addition, to improve mobility of the second fixer 130, a weight block may be attached to the second fixer 130 to ensure that the second fixer 130 may move by its own gravity. Referring to 13, in one exemplary embodiment, if the second fixer 130 is displaced via magnetic force, then the cell culture module 100K further includes a magnetic control part 160K. In contrast, a second fixer 130K of the present embodiment has magnetism. Therefore, the magnetic control part 160K may control the second fixer 130K to move by a magnetic force such as a magnetic attraction force or a magnetic repulsion force. When the magnetic control part 160K magnetically controls the second fixer 130K to move to a position away from the first fixer 120, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the open state. When the magnetic control part 160K controls the second fixer 130K to move to a position close to the first fixer 120, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the folded state. The shape of the magnetic control part 160K of the present embodiment is not limited as long as the magnetic control part 160K may be close to the surface of the casing 111 and the magnetic control part 160A itself is movable, thereby driving the second fixer 130K to move, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In another exemplary embodiment, the cell culture module 100K may be placed upright to provide the second fixer 130K to assist in moving displacement due to its own weight. Referring to 14, in one exemplary embodiment, a cell culture module 100L further includes a fastener 170. In addition, the casing 111 further has an elastic corrugated structure 111A. The elastic crease structure 111A is the same as the elastic corrugated structure 110A1 in the cell culture module 100D of 4A and 4B described above. In an unstressed state, the elastic corrugated structure 111A is, for example, the stretched state of 14. The fastener 170 is configured to control whether the elastic corrugated structure 111A maintains a compressed state or not to switch between the stretched state and the compressed state. A second fixer 130L of the present embodiment is fixed to the casing 111 and the elastic corrugated structure 111A is located between the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130L. When the fastener 170 is fastened, the elastic corrugated structure 111A is in a compressed state and therefore the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130L are close to each other, so that the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the folded state. When the fastener 170 is unfastened, the elastic corrugated structure 111A is in the stretched state and therefore the first fixer 120 and the second fixer 130L are away from each other, so that the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the open state. It should be noted that although the fastener 170 is taken as an example in the present embodiment, the fastener 170 may also be arbitrarily replaced with other fixers, such as a velcro, a screw, a rope and the like. Referring to 15, in one exemplary embodiment, a cell culture module 100M is similar to the cell culture module 100E of 5 and further includes a rod 180 and a guide hole 182. The guide hole 182 is located at one end of the casing 111 opposite to the first fixer 120 to guide the rod 180 to movably penetrate the casing 111. The rod 180 is connected to the second fixer 130 to control the second fixer 130 to move. By controlling the degree of stretch of the rod 180 into the casing 111, the second fixer 130B may be controlled to move to a position close to or away from the first fixer 120. It should be noted that in the present embodiment, the second fixer 130 and the tapered portion 113 are located at corresponding different sides of the casing 111, but in other exemplary embodiments, the second fixer 130 and the tapered portion 113 may be at the same side of the casing 111 i. e. , the rod 180 and the guide hole 182 are disposed at the same side as the tapered portion 113, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. Referring to 16, in one exemplary embodiment, a cell culture module 100N is similar to the cell culture module 100F of 6 and further includes a fluid pressure control part 190 disposed at the casing 111 and located in the chamber C10. The second fixer 130 is located between the fluid pressure control part 190 and the first fixer 120. The fluid pressure control part 190 is configured to control the second fixer 130 to move. For example, the fluid pressure control part 190 is applicable to bags for containing fluids. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto. As a gas, water, oil or other fluid contained in the fluid pressure control part 190 increases, the volume of the fluid pressure control part 190 also increases, thus pushing the second fixer 130 to move in a direction approaching the first fixer 120. As the gas, water, oil or other fluid contained in the fluid pressure control part 190 decreases, the volume of the fluid pressure control part 190 also decreases, thus allowing the second fixer 130 to move in a direction away from the first fixer 120. In the present embodiment, the second fixer 130 and the tapered portion 113 are located at corresponding different sides of the casing 111, but in other exemplary embodiments, the second fixer 130 and the tapered portion 113 may be at the same side of the casing i. e. , the fluid pressure control part 190 is disposed at the same side as the tapered portion 113, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. 17 is a schematic of a cell culture system according to another exemplary embodiment. A cell culture system 2000 of the present embodiment includes a cell tank 200, a culture medium module 300 and a cell culture module 400A. The cell tank 200 and the culture medium module 300 respectively communicate with the cell culture module 400A. The cell culture module 400A may be the cell culture module of each of the foregoing embodiments such as the cell culture modules 100H to 100N or other cell culture modules conforming to the spirit according to one or more exemplary embodiments and a detailed description of the cell culture module 400A is omitted herein. Since a cell culture system 2000 of the present embodiment adopts the same cell culture module 400A as the cell culture module of each of the foregoing embodiments, the cell culture system 2000 of the present embodiment may increase the yield and recovery rate of the cell culture. In addition, the cell culture system 2000 of the present embodiment may optionally further include a pump 500, a cleaning solution tank 600, a cell detachment enzyme tank 700 and a controller 800. The cell tank 200 and the culture medium module 300 respectively communicate with the cell culture module 400A via the pump 500. The cleaning solution tank 600 and the cell detachment enzyme tank 700 also both communicate with the cell culture module 400A, such as communicate with the cell culture module 400A via the pump 500. The controller 800 is connected to the cell tank 200, the cleaning solution tank 600, the cell detachment enzyme tank 700, the cell culture module 400A and the culture medium module 300 respectively via the pump 500, the culture medium sensor 314 and the pump 320 to control the pump 500, the pump 320, the regulator 330 and the culture medium sensor 314. When performing cell culture, first, the cells to be cultured are attached to the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 in the folded state. In detail, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 of the cell culture module 400A may be first in the folded state and the configuration of each pipeline of the system may be completed. In particular, the method of configuration of the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 of the cell culture module 400A in the folded state includes moving the second fixer 130 to a position close to the first fixer 120. However, the method is not limited thereto and as in the foregoing embodiments, the second fixer 130 may be displaced by gravity, magnetic force, or other mechanical force, which is not repeated herein. Next, the cells to be cultured in the cell tank 200 are sent to the cell culture module 400A using the pump 500 to inoculated the cells to be cultured on the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 in the folded state. In other exemplary embodiments, when the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 of the cell culture module 400A are in the open state, each pipeline of the system is first configured and then the cells are inoculated on the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 in the open state. Then, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 of the cell culture module 400A is rendered into the folded state for subsequent cell culture steps, but the disclosure is not limited to the above. After the cells are attached, a culture medium is perfused and circulated in the cell culture module 400A and a cell culture is started. Next, the culture medium is discharged and a cleaning solution is perfused and then the remaining culture medium is removed by immersion and cleaning. Next, a cell detachment enzyme is perfused such that the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 and the cells are immersed therein and when the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is in the open state, the cells are desorbed from the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 and suspended in the suspension of the cell culture module 400A. In detail, in one exemplary embodiment, the cell desorbing enzyme may be perfused first and then the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 is loosened from the folded state and transformed into the open state of a two-dimensional structure. In other exemplary embodiments, the sheet-shaped carrier member 14 may also first be loosened from the folded state and transformed into the open state of a two-dimensional structure and then the cell detachment enzyme is perfused, but the disclosure is not limited to the above. Lastly, the suspension containing the cells is collected. The detailed operation steps are the same as those of the foregoing cell culture system 1000 and are not repeated herein. As mentioned above, in the cell culture module and cell culture system in the present embodiment, since the second fixer is movable, the sheet-shaped carrier member may switch between the open state and the folded state according to a variation in a distance between the first fixer and the second fixer at two ends of the sheet-shaped carrier member. The sheet-shaped carrier member in the folded state helps to increase the yield of the cell culture, and the sheet-shaped carrier member in the open state may improve the cell recovery rate and the quality of the collected cells. It should be noted that in the disclosure, when the cell culture carriers are in the untwisted/twisted state and the sheet-shaped carrier member is in the open/folded state, the cell growth region created by the plurality of cell culture carriers is roughly changed between a two-dimensional surface state/three-dimensional space, which is intended to be described in terms of the different laying methods of the cell culture carriers, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations may be made to the structure of the disclosed embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit according to one or more exemplary embodiments.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "The present invention relates to a binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes used for forming an electrode of a nonaqueous battery, a binder for nonaqueous battery electrodes obtained by emulsion polymerizing the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes, a composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes comprising the binder for nonaqueous battery electrodes and also an electrode active material, a nonaqueous battery electrode formed by using the composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes, and an nonaqueous battery obtained by using the nonaqueous battery electrode.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Typical examples of nonaqueous batteries include lithium ion secondary batteries. The nonaqueous batteries are used, in terms of reduction in size and weight of power sources, as power sources for notebook personal computers, mobile telephones, electric power tools, and electronic communications equipment. Recently, they have also used, from the point of view of their applicability to environmental vehicles, for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. Under such circumstances, higher output, higher capacity, and longer life of the nonaqueous batteries is strongly desired. The nonaqueous battery is a secondary battery comprising a positive electrode using a metal oxide or the like as an active material, a negative electrode using a carbon material such as graphite as an active material, and an electrolyte solvent with a carbonate or a flame-retardant ionic liquid as a main ingredient, in which charge and discharge of the battery is performed by the movement of ions between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Particularly, the positive electrode is obtained by coating the surface of a positive electrode collector such as aluminum foil with a slurry comprising a metal oxide and a binder, drying the coating, and then cutting the coated positive electrode collector to a suitable size. The negative electrode is obtained by coating the surface of a negative electrode collector such as copper foil with a slurry comprising a carbon material and a binder, drying the coating, and then cutting the coated negative electrode collector to a suitable size. Therefore, each binder has a role of binding active materials to each other and binding an active material to a collector to prevent peeling of active materials from a collector. As the binder, a polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF-based binder using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone NMP of an organic solvent system as a solvent is well known PTL 1. However, this binder has a low binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector, and a large amount of binder is required for practical use. As a result, the capacity of the resulting nonaqueous battery is reduced, which is a defect. In addition, since an expensive organic solvent NMP is used for binders, there is a problem also in the price of end products and the preservation of work environment during the production of a slurry or a collector. As a method for solving these problems, the development of a water-dispersed binder has been advanced. For example, there is known a styrene-butadiene rubber SBR-based aqueous dispersion in which carboxymethyl cellulose CMC is used in combination as a thickener PTL 2. Since this SBR-based dispersion is an aqueous dispersion, it is inexpensive and advantageous from the point of view of the preservation of work environment. Further, since the binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector is relatively satisfactory, electrodes can be produced by using a smaller amount of the SBR-based dispersion than the amount of the PVDF-based binder. As a result, there is an advantage that higher output and higher capacity of nonaqueous batteries can be achieved. From these advantages, the SBR-based dispersion is widely used as a binder for nonaqueous battery electrodes. However, also in this binder, the binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector is not necessarily sufficient, and when an electrode is produced with a small amount of binder, a part of an active material is peeled off in the step of cutting a collector, which is problematic. Further, the SBR-based binder has low elution resistance and swelling resistance to a nonaqueous solvent used for electrolytes and thus has a problem that longer life cannot be achieved for a nonaqueous battery obtained by using the binder. Under such a background, PTL 3 proposes a method involving using a non-diene-based polymer essentially comprising of styrene and an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid ester as a water-dispersed binder instead of conventional SBR. It is disclosed that when this binder is used, the binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector is satisfactory, and that a charge-discharge cycle property is improved. However, there is still room for improvement in the electrolyte resistance and charge-discharge cycle property. Further, PTLs 4 to 6 proposes that an acidic group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer is polymerized and used as a binder for secondary battery electrodes. They mention, as the acidic group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer, a carboxylic group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer, a sulfuric acid containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer and a phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer. However, there is still room for improvement in the charge-discharge cycle property.",
                    "DESCRIPTION": "When the following binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes is used, an electrode having a good cycle property can be obtained. &lt;Binder Composition for Nonaqueous Battery Electrodes&gt;The binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes essentially comprises A an ethylenically unsaturated monomer and B a surfactant and further satisfies any two or more conditions of the following I to III:I A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer comprises a a phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer;II B the surfactant comprises b a phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant; andIII the composition comprises C a neutralizing agent comprising an alkali metal compound and/or an alkali earth metal compound. The binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes hereinafter also referred to binder composition contains phosphorus atoms derived from a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer and b the phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant in the total amount of from 0. 01 to 3. 0 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the total amount of A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and B the surfactant.

When the binder composition satisfies the condition of above III and satisfies any one condition of the above I or II, the amount in the composition of phosphorus atoms derived from any one of a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer and b the phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant is from 0. 01 to 3. 0 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the total amount of A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer and B the surfactant. The amount of phosphorus atoms is preferably from 0. 02 to 0. 8 parts by mass, and more preferably from 0. 40 to 0. 75 parts by mass. In addition, from the point of view of a charge-discharge cycle property of secondary batteries, the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes preferably satisfies the conditions of the above I and III. In addition, from the point of view of a charge-discharge cycle property of secondary batteries, the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes preferably satisfies the conditions of the above II and III. In addition, from the point of view of a charge-discharge cycle property of secondary batteries, the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes preferably satisfies the conditions of the above I and II. Furthermore, the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes preferably satisfies all conditions of the above I, II and III. &lt;A Ethylenically Unsaturated Monomer&gt;The above-mentioned A ethylenically unsaturated monomer comprises at least one of a a phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer and an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which does not correspond to a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer. However, when the binder composition does not satisfy the condition of the above II, A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer must comprise a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Further, when the binder composition satisfies the conditions of the above I and III, A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer must also comprise a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Inclusion of phosphoric atoms in the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes improves the cycle property of the battery prepared therefrom and improves the life property of the battery prepared therefrom during the charge and discharge cycle. a Phosphoric Acid Group-Containing Ethylenically Unsaturated MonomerThe ethylenically unsaturated monomer A preferably comprises a a phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer. The phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer a is a monomer containing an ethylenically unsaturated group and a phosphoric acid group in its molecule, and preferably a compound represented by the following general formula 1 or 2:wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; R2 represents a divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms which may have a halogen group or an ether group; and R3 represents a hydrogen atom or an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aromatic hydrocarbon group; or R3 represents a cation selected from the group consisting of ammonium, sodium, lithium, potassium and alcohol amino half salt; orwherein R4 and R7 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; and R5 and R6 each independently represent a divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms. The phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer a is preferably from 0. 03 to 15. 0 mol %, more preferably from 0. 3 to 8. 0 mol %, and still more preferably from 0. 5 to 4. 0 mol % based on the total amount of A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes. When the amount of a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer used is 0. 03 mol % or more, the cycle property of the electrode prepared from the binder composition is improved, while when the amount used is 15. 0 mol % or less, the adhesion to active materials is good and the life property of the battery prepared therefrom during the charge and discharge cycle is thus good. Examples of a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer include 2-methacryloyloxyethyl acid phosphate, bis2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate phosphate, acid phosphooxypolyoxyethylene glycol monomethacrylate, acid phosphooxypolyoxypropylene glycol monomethacrylate, 3-chloro-2-acid phosphooxypropyl methacrylate, and methacroyloxyethyl acid phosphate monoethanolamine half salt. Particularly preferred are 2-methacryloyloxyethyl acid phosphate, bis2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate phosphate and acid phosphooxypolyoxyethylene glycol monomethacrylate. Ethylenically Unsaturated Monomer which does not Correspond to a Phosphoric Acid Group-Containing Ethylenically Unsaturated MonomerThe binder composition preferably contains a a phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer as well as an ethylenically unsaturated monomer A which does not correspond to a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Examples of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer which does not correspond to a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer include styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, alkyl meth acrylate such as 2-ethylhexyl acrylate 2-EHA, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate 2-HEMA and tert-butyl meth acrylate TBMA, sodium p-toluenesulfonate, vinylpyrrolidone, vinylacetamide, N-alkylmethacrylamide, N, N-dialkylmethacrylamide, N-hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide with the alkyl group having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, diacetone meth acrylamide, and dimethylaminoalkylmethacrylamide with the alkyl group other than the alkyl group of the dimethylamino group having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and methacrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid. From the viewpoint of availability, styrene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid, and alkyl meth acrylate such as 2-ethylhexyl acrylate 2-EHA and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate 2-HEMA are preferred among them. The amount of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer which does not correspond to a the phosphoric acid group-containing ethylenically unsaturated monomer is preferably 20% by mass or less and more preferably 10% by mass or less based on the solid content of the synthetic resin emulsion, and the amount thereof in the component A is preferably from 85 to 100 mol %, more preferably from 92. 0 to 99. 7 mol %, still more preferably from 85 to 99. 07 mol %, and particularly preferably from 96. 0 to 99. 5 mol %. However, if the binder composition contains a conjugated diene such as butadiene or isoprene as a polymerizable monomer, an adequate cycle property cannot be obtained when the amount of the binder used is reduced. Therefore, the binder composition preferably contains 1% or less of the conjugated diene as a polymerizable monomer. Further, the ethylenically unsaturated monomer A subjected to emulsion polymerization may comprise a molecular weight modifier such as mercaptan, thioglycolic acid and an ester thereof, and -mercaptopropionic acid and an ester thereof, in order to adjust the molecular weight of the polymer. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer A is preferably 95. 0 parts by mass or more and 99. 5 parts by mass or less, more preferably 95. 5 parts by mass or more and 99. 0 parts by mass or less, and still more preferably 96. 0 parts by mass or more and 98. 5 parts by mass or less based on 100 parts by mass of the solid content of the synthetic resin emulsion. As the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes essentially comprises A an ethylenically unsaturated monomer and B a surfactant and further satisfies any two or more conditions of the above I to III, as described above, solid content of a synthetic resin emulsion refers to solid content of A an ethylenically unsaturated monomer and B a surfactant or solid content of A an ethylenically unsaturated monomer, B a surfactant and C a neutralizing agent comprising an alkali metal compound and/or an alkali earth metal compound, depending on the condition. When preparing a resin from the binder composition of the present invention, the binder composition may be preferably emulsion polymerized in an aqueous medium. The emulsion polymerization is suitably performed in an aqueous medium using a radical polymerization initiator. Examples of the emulsion polymerization process include a process in which all of the components used for the emulsion polymerization are charged at once and are subjected to emulsion polymerization and a process in which each component used for the emulsion polymerization is continuously fed while subjecting to emulsion polymerization. Among these processes, the process in which each component used for emulsion polymerization is continuously fed while subjecting to emulsion polymerization is preferred, because it produces fine binder particles having a uniform particle size and efficiently removes heat during reaction. The emulsion polymerization is generally performed at a temperature of from 30 to 90 C. with stirring. &lt;B Surfactant&gt;Examples of the surfactant B used for the binder composition of the present application include an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant and a nonionic surfactant, but an anionic surfactant and a nonionic surfactant are preferred. Examples of the anionic surfactant include an alkylbenzenesulfonic acid salt, an alkylsulfuric ester salt, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfuric ester salt, and a fatty acid salt. Examples of the nonionic surfactant include polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene polycyclic phenyl ether, polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, sorbitan fatty acid ester, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester. The surfactant B preferably comprises b a phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant. The phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant b preferably at least contains a compound represented by the following general formula 3:wherein R8 represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms or a group represented by the following formula 4: [Formula 9] R9OnR104wherein R9 represents a divalent aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 2 or 3 carbon atoms; R10 represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms or a group represented by the following formula 5; and n is an integer of from 1 to 10:wherein x is an integer of from 1 to 5. Further, it is more preferred to use the combination of two or more surfactants of b the phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant and B a surfactant which does not correspond to b the phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant. Among the surfactants, b the phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant is a surfactant having a phosphoric acid group in the molecule. Examples of b the phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant include lauryl phosphate, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether phosphate ester, C12-15pareth-6 phosphate diester or half ester or a mixtures thereof, polyoxyethylene tridecyl ether phosphate ester, polyoxyethylene octyl ether phosphate ester, polyoxyethylene styrenated phenyl ether phosphate ester, and polyoxypropylene allyl ether phosphate ester. Among them, lauryl phosphate, polyoxyethylene lauryl ether phosphate ester, polyoxyethylene styrenated phenyl ether phosphate ester are preferred. As used herein, styrenated phenyl refers to a phenyl group with one or more styrene molecules added as described below, and the structure of the styrenated phenyl with an oxygen atom removed corresponds to the moiety of R10 in the above chemical formula 5:wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 5. The amount of b phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant comprised in B the surfactant in the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes is preferably from 1. 0 to 60. 0% by mass, more preferably from 5. 0 to 55. 0% by mass, and still more preferably from 10 to 50. 0% by mass. When the amount of the surfactant used is 1. 0% by mass or more, the cycle property of the battery is improved. When the amount of the surfactant used is 60. 0% by mass or less, the emulsion polymerization stability and mechanical stability is improved. Even if the surfactant has an ethylenically unsaturated bond, it is not included in the ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the present invention. The amount of b the phosphoric acid group-containing surfactant used is preferably from 0. 1 to 2 parts by mass based on A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. When the amount of the surfactant used is 0. 1 parts by mass or more, the cycle property of the battery is improved. When the amount of the surfactant used is 2 parts by mass or less, the emulsion polymerization stability and mechanical stability is improved. Again, even if the surfactant has an ethylenically unsaturated bond, it is not included in the ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the present invention. The surfactant may be used alone or in combination of two or more. The surfactant having no phosphoric acid group B is not particularly limited. However, when the surfactant represented by the following general formulas 6 to 9 is used, the stability of particles is improved. General Formula 6wherein R represents an alkyl group, and m represents an integer of from 10 to 40. General Formula 7wherein x represents an integer of from 10 to 12, and y represents an integer of from 10 to 40. General Formula 8wherein R represents an alkyl group, and M represents NH4 or Na. General Formula 9wherein R represents an alkyl group. The total amount of B the surfactant used is preferably from 0. 1 to 3 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of the total amount of A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. When the amount of the surfactant used is 0. 1 parts by mass or more, emulsion polymerization can be easily performed and the mechanical stability of the resulting binder is raised. Further, the amount of the surfactant used is preferably 0. 1 parts by mass or more, because the size of particles contained in a water-dispersed emulsion which is the binder obtained by emulsion polymerization is small and the particles are thereby resistant to setting. When the amount of the surfactant used is 3 parts by mass or less, the adhesion between an active material and a collector tends to be improved. Again, even if the surfactant has an ethylenically unsaturated bond and is for example that shown in any one of the above formulas 6 to 9, 5 to 8, it is not included in A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the present invention. &lt;C Neutralizing Agent Comprising at Least One of Alkali Metal Compound and Alkali Earth Metal Compound&gt;Examples of C the neutralizing agent comprising at least one of an alkali metal compound and an alkali earth metal compound hereinafter also referred to C neutralizing agent include lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide is preferred, and sodium hydroxide is more preferred. The amount of C the neutralizing agent used is suitably from 0. 1 to 5 parts by mass, preferably from 0. 3 to 4 parts by mass, and more preferably 0. 5 to 3 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the total amount of A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer. The amount of C the neutralizing agent used of 0. 5 parts by mass or more improves emulsion polymerization stability and mechanical stability as well as the binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector. On the other hand, the amount of C the neutralizing agent used of 3 parts by mass or less improves the binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector. &lt;Polymerization Initiator&gt;The radical polymerization initiator used in the emulsion polymerization is not particularly limited, and a known radical polymerization initiator can be used. Examples of the radical polymerization initiator include ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, hydrogen peroxide, and t-butyl hydroperoxide. Further, the emulsion polymerization may optionally be redox polymerization in which a radical polymerization initiator is used in combination with a reducing agent such as sodium bisulfite, Rongalite, and ascorbic acid. In the present invention, water is generally used as an aqueous medium, but a medium obtained by adding a hydrophilic solvent to water may be used as an aqueous medium unless the polymerization stability of the resulting binder is impaired. Examples of the hydrophilic solvent to be added to water include methanol, ethanol, and N-methylpyrrolidone. &lt;Binder for Nonaqueous Battery Electrodes&gt;When polymerizing the binder composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes and preparing a binder for nonaqueous battery electrodes hereinafter also referred to binder therefrom, the binder composition is preferably emulsion polymerized in an aqueous medium. Then, the binder is obtained as a binder dispersion having a polymer dispersed in the aqueous medium. The non-volatile matter of the binder dispersion is preferably from 20 to 60% by mass, and more preferably from 30 to 50% by mass. The pH of the binder dispersion is preferably from 1. 5 to 10, more preferably from 4 to 9, and still more preferably from 6 to 9. The viscosity of the binder dispersion is preferably from 1 to 5000 mPas. The non-volatile matter of the binder dispersion in the present invention is calculated as a residue after weighing out about 1 g of a resin in a plate-like container such as a dish or a plate and drying the resin at 105 C. for 1 hour. The viscosity of the binder dispersion in the present invention is measured by changing the measurement method depending on whether the viscosity is 500 mPas or more or less than 500 mPas. The measurement method for the viscosity of 500 mPas or more is first performed, and if the measurement result is less than 500 mPas, the measurement is performed by changing the measurement condition to the condition described below. When the viscosity of the binder dispersion was 500 mPas or more, the viscosity was measured using a Brookfield type rotational viscometer with a 2 or a 3 rotor at a liquid temperature of 23 C. and a number of revolution of 10 rpm. On the other hand, when the viscosity of the binder dispersion was less than 500 mPas, the viscosity was measured using a Brookfield type rotational viscometer with a 2 rotor at a liquid temperature of 23 C. and a number of revolution of 60 rpm for example, in the case of Comparative Example 4 and Example 2 as described below. The glass transition temperature Tg of the binder for nonaqueous battery electrodes of the present invention is preferably from 55 to 30 C. , more preferably from 25 to 25 C. , and particularly preferably from 20 to 10 C. When the Tg of the binder is in the above range, the binding property between active materials of the binder and between an active material and a collector will be developed, and a crack of the electrode obtained using a slurry comprising the binder and an active material can be easily prevented. If the Tg of the binder is less than 55 C. , the binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector will tend to be reduced. Further, if the Tg of the binder is higher than 30 C. , a crack will easily occur in the electrode obtained by applying a slurry comprising the binder and an active material. The Tg of the binder can be adjusted by changing the content of styrene included in the ethylenically unsaturated monomers and the type or the amount of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The glass transition temperature of the binder for nonaqueous battery electrodes of the present invention is a theoretical value calculated with good approximation by the following formula I from the glass transition temperature Tgi i=1, 2, . . . , i of each homopolymer of A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer Mi i=1, 2, . . . , i to be used in the emulsion polymerization of the polymer for binders and each weight fraction Xi i=1, 2, . . . , i of A the ethylenically unsaturated monomer Mi. 1/Tg=Xi/TgiI &lt;Composition for Nonaqueous Battery Electrodes&gt;Next, the composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes will be described in detail. In the present specification, the composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes is sometimes represented by slurry or a slurry composition, but they all mean the same thing. The slurry of the present invention comprises the binder for nonaqueous battery electrodes described above, an active material, and an aqueous medium and optionally a thickener, and is prepared by dispersing or dissolving the binder dispersion, the active material, and the optional thickener in the aqueous medium. The content of the binder included in the slurry in terms of non-volatile matter of the binder dispersion is preferably from 0. 1 to 1. 8 parts by mass, more preferably from 0. 3 to 1. 6 parts by mass, most preferably from 0. 5 to 1. 5 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the electrode active material. If the amount used of the non-volatile matter of the binder dispersion is less than 0. 1 part by mass, the binding property between an active material and a collector is poor, and the charge-discharge cycle property tends to be reduced; and if the amount used of the non-volatile matter of the binder composition is more than 1. 8 parts by mass, the internal resistance of the battery will increase to reduce the initial capacity, and the charge-discharge cycle property tends to be reduced. The electrode active material may be a material which can dope/dedope lithium or the like. When the slurry for nonaqueous battery electrodes is for forming a negative electrode, examples of the active material include conductive polymers such as polyacethylene and polypyrrole; cokes such as coke, petroleum coke, pitch coke, and coal coke; polymer charcoal; carbon fiber; carbon black such as acetylene black; graphite such as artificial graphite and natural graphite; lithium titanate; and silicon. Among these active materials, it is preferred to use carbon black, graphite, natural graphite, lithium titanate, silicon, and the like from the point that the energy density per volume is high. Among them, when the active material is a carbon material, specifically, cokes such as coke, petroleum coke, pitch coke, and coal coke; polymer charcoal; carbon fiber; carbon black such as acetylene black; and graphite such as artificial graphite and natural graphite, the effect of improving the binding property by the binder of the present invention is remarkable. When the composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes is for forming a positive electrode, the positive electrode active material is not particularly limited as long as it is a positive electrode active material that can be used for a nonaqueous battery, and lithium cobaltate LiCoO2; lithium composite oxides containing nickel such as a NiCoMn-based lithium composite oxide, a NiMnAl-based lithium composite oxide, and a NiCoAl-based lithium composite oxide; spinel-type lithium manganate LiMn2O4; olivine-type iron phosphate lithium; and charcogen compounds such as TiS2, MnO2, MoO3, and V2O5 are used singly or in combination. Further, metal oxides in which other alkali metals are used can also be used. The non-volatile matter concentration of the composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes is preferably from 30 to 70% by mass, more preferably from 40 to 60% by mass. Further, the viscosity of the composition for nonaqueous battery electrodes slurry is preferably from 500 to 20,000 mPas, more preferably from 5,000 to 20,000 mPas. When the non-volatile matter and the viscosity of the slurry are in this range, the slurry provides good coatability to a collecting electrode plate and is excellent in the productivity of an electrode. The non-volatile matter concentration of the slurry is adjusted by the amount of an aqueous medium dispersion medium. Further, the viscosity of the slurry is adjusted by the amount of a dispersion medium and a thickener. Generally, with respect to the dispersion medium, water or a hydrophilic solvent is further added to a dispersion medium derived from a binder dispersion. Examples of the hydrophilic solvent include methanol, ethanol, and N-methylpyrrolidone. Examples of the thickener include cellulose such as carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and hydroxypropyl cellulose, and ammonium and alkali metal salts thereof, polymethacrylic acid and ammonium salts and alkali metal salts thereof, polyvinylacetamide PNVA, or NVA-sodium acrylate copolymers, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Among these thickeners, carboxymethyl cellulose and polymethacrylic acid, and ammonium salts and alkali metal salts thereof, polyvinylacetamide PNVA, and NVA-sodium acrylate copolymers are preferably used because a slurry in which an active material is dispersed can be easily produced. The amount added of the thickener included in the slurry is preferably from 0. 5 to 1. 5 parts by mass based on 100 parts by mass of an active material. When the slurry comprises the thickener in the above amount, the coatability of the slurry will be improved, and the binding property between active materials and between an active material and a collector in the active material layer prepared by coating and drying the slurry will be further improved. The method for preparing a slurry is not particularly limited, and any known method can be used. Examples include a method involving mixing a binder dispersion, an active material, an optional thickener, and an aqueous medium dispersion medium using a mixer such as a stirring mixer, a rotating mixer and a shaking mixer. From the point of view of the durability of a battery and the like, the pH of the slurry is preferably from 2 to 10, more preferably from 4 to 9, and still more preferably from 6 to 9. &lt;Electrode for Nonaqueous Batteries&gt;The electrode electrode for nonaqueous batteries of the present invention may be formed using the slurry described above. For example, the electrode can be produced by coating a collector with a slurry, drying the slurry to form an active material layer, and then cutting the coated collector to a suitable size. Examples of the collector used for the electrode include, but are not particularly limited to, a collector made of metal, such as iron, copper, aluminum, nickel, and stainless steel. Further, the shape of the collector is not particularly limited, and a sheet having a thickness of from 0. 001 to 0. 5 mm is generally used. The method of coating a collector with a slurry is not particularly limited, and a common coating method can be used. Examples include a reverse roll method, a direct roll method, a doctor blade method, a knife method, an extrusion method, a curtain method, a gravure method, a bar method, a clip method, and a squeeze method. Among these, it is preferred to use a doctor blade method, a knife method, or an extrusion method, in that it is suitable for various physical properties such as viscosity and drying characteristics of the slurry used for the nonaqueous battery electrode, and in that it enable a coating film having a satisfactory surface state to be obtained. The slurry may be applied only to one surface of a collector or may be applied to both surfaces thereof. When the slurry is applied to both surfaces of the collector, one surface may be applied before the other surface, or both surfaces may be applied at the same time. Further, the slurry may be continuously applied to the surface of a collector or may be intermittently applied thereto. The thickness, length, and width of a coating film prepared by applying the slurry can be suitably determined depending on the size of a battery and the like. The method for drying the coating film prepared by applying the slurry to form an active material layer is not particularly limited, and a known method can be used. For example, as a drying method, hot wind, vacuum, far infrared rays, electron beams, and low-temperature wind may be used singly or in combination. The temperature for drying the coating film is generally in the range of from 40 to 180 C. , and the drying time is generally from 1 to 30 minutes. The collector in which the active material layer is formed is cut to a size and shape suitable as an electrode. The method for cutting the collector in which the active material layer is formed is not particularly limited, and, for example, a slit, a laser, wire cut, a cutter, a Thomson blade, and the like can be used. The collector in which the active material layer is formed may be optionally pressed before or after cutting the collector, thereby capable of reducing the peeling of the active material and miniaturizing the nonaqueous battery by the reduction in thickness of the electrode. A common method can be used as a method of pressing, and particularly, a mold press method and a roll press method are preferably used. The pressing pressure is preferably, but not particularly limited to, from 0. 5 to 5 t/cm2, which is the range where the pressing does not influence the doping/dedoping of lithium ions or the like into the active material. A nonaqueous solution having high ion conductivity can be used as the electrolytic solution. Examples of the solution include an organic solvent, an ionic liquid, and acetonitrile in which an electrolyte is dissolved. &lt;Nonaqueous Battery&gt;The battery nonaqueous battery of the present invention comprises the electrode described above. The battery is prepared by receiving a positive electrode, a negative electrode, an electrolytic solution, and an optionally installed component such as a separator in an outer packaging body, and the electrode of the present invention can be used for one or both of the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Examples of the shape of the electrode include, but are not particularly limited to, a laminate and a wound body. A known alkali metal salt can be used as the electrolyte, and the electrolyte can be suitably selected depending on the type or the like of the active material. Examples of the electrolyte include LiClO4, LiBF6, LiPF6, LiCF3SO3, LiCF3CO2, LiAsF6, LiSbF6, LiB10Cl10, LiAlCl4, LiCl, LiBr, LiBC2H54, CF3SO3Li, CH3SO3Li, LiCF3SO3, LiC4F9SO3, LiCF3SO22N, and a lithium aliphatic carboxylate. Further, salts in which other alkali metals are used can also be used. A known organic solvent or ionic liquid can be used without particular limitation as the organic solvent or ionic liquid for dissolving an electrolyte. For example, ethylene carbonate EC, propylene carbonate PC, diethyl carbonate DEC, methylethyl carbonate MEC, and dimethyl carbonate DMC and the like can be used as the organic solvent. Further, with respect to the ionic liquid, as a constituting ion of the ionic liquid, N,N-bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide and fluorosulfonylimide and the like can be used as the anion, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium and N,N-dimethyl-N-ethyl-N-methoxyethylammonium and the like can be used as the cation. These electrolytic solutions may be used singly or in combination of two or more. A metal outer packaging body, an aluminum-laminated outer packaging body, and the like can be suitably used as the outer packaging body. The shape of the battery may be any shape, including a coin type, a button type, a sheet type, a cylinder type, a square type, and a flat type. The battery of the present embodiment can be produced using a known production method.",

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "In recent years, a so-called PR Passivated Rear structure-type solar cell has been proposed as a highly efficient solar cell. Characteristics of the PR structure-type solar cell are that the rear surface of a substrate is covered with a protective film that has a high passivation effect and in which an optical loss less easily occurs and a contact part of the substrate and a back electrode is localized to reduce surface recombination of carriers. This back electrode includes bus bar electrodes for extracting a photo-generated current generated in the solar cell to the outside and finger electrodes that are connected to these bus bar electrodes and in contact with the substrate. Note that, in the following explanation, a surface of the substrate on a light receiving surface side of a solar cell is referred to as a light receiving surface and a surface of the substrate on the opposite side of the light receiving surface is referred to as a rear surface. In general, the finger electrodes and the bus bar electrodes functioning as the back electrode are formed by printing conductive silver paste containing glass frit or the like and thereafter drying and baking the conductive silver paste to penetrate a passivation film. However, the conductive silver paste is expensive because silver is a main component. Use of the conductive silver paste leads to an increase in the manufacturing cost of the solar cell. When the conductive silver paste is used, there is a problem in that surface recombination rate in contact sections of the electrodes and the substrate increases. There is also a problem in that contact resistance between the substrate, on which a diffusion layer is not formed or surface concentration of the diffusion layer is low, and the electrodes is extremely high. Therefore, there is a demand for an electrode that is inexpensive, has low contact resistance, and can reduce surface recombination rate. In order to solve the problems, it is desirable to use, as a method of forming the finger electrodes, a method of printing conductive aluminum paste and thereafter drying and baking the conductive aluminum paste to penetrate the passivation film. The conductive aluminum paste has an extremely low unit price per gram. Manufacturing cost can be reduced. During the baking of the conductive aluminum paste, a p+ layer is formed in a contact section of the substrate and the conductive aluminum paste. Therefore, there is an advantage that, compared with when the conductive silver paste is used, an increase in the surface recombination rate in the contact sections of the electrodes and the substrate can be suppressed and the contact resistance between the substrate, on which a diffusion layer is not formed or surface concentration of the diffusion layer is low, and the electrodes can be reduced. Further, in order to solve the problems, as a method of forming the bus bar electrode, it is desirable to use a method of printing low-temperature thermosetting silver paste and thereafter drying and heating the low-temperature thermosetting silver paste to connect the low-temperature thermosetting silver paste to only the finger electrodes. An electrode formed using the low-temperature thermosetting silver paste does not penetrate the passivation film. Therefore, a photo-generated current collected from connecting sections to the finger electrodes can be efficiently extracted to the outside without increasing the surface recombination rate of the substrate. From the demand explained above, in the PR structure-type solar battery cell, it is desirable to form the finger electrodes by baking the conductive aluminum paste and form the bus bar electrodes by heating the low-temperature thermosetting silver paste. However, aluminum oxide films having high resistance are formed on the electrode surfaces of the finger electrodes formed by baking the conductive aluminum paste. Therefore, there is a problem in that contact resistance between the finger electrodes and the bus bar electrodes formed using the low-temperature thermosetting silver paste is high. As measures against such a problem, there is a method of removing the aluminum oxide films with ultrasonic cleaning and photochemical etching of the aluminum oxide films , Patent Literature 1. However, in this case, a new problem occurs in that complicated etching processes increase, leading to a cost increase, heavy metal contamination on the substrate occurs during cleaning and a life time decreases, and a yield decreases. There is a method of performing processing for cleaning and activating the surfaces of the aluminum oxide films of the finger electrodes and partially covering the surfaces with an adhesion promoter to enable the finger electrodes to be bonded with the bus bar electrodes , Patent Literature 2. However, in this case as well, a problem occurs in that a cost increase due to cleaning work of the surfaces and a yield decrease easily occur. Besides, there is also a method of removing the aluminum oxide films with sandblast by aluminum beads , Patent Literature 3. However, there is a problem in that the substrate surface is damaged to increase the surface recombination rate and reduce a yield.",
                    "DESCRIPTION": "An embodiment of the present invention is explained in detail below. Note that the present invention can be carried out in a wide range of other embodiments in addition to the following explanation. The scope of the present invention is not limited to the following explanation and is described in the scope of claims. Further, the drawings are not shown in proportion to actual sizes. To further clarify the explanation and the understanding of the present invention, dimensions are enlarged depending on related members. Unimportant portions are not illustrated. General PR Structure-Type Solar Battery CellFirst, a manufacturing process for a general PR structure-type solar cell is explained with reference to 1, which is a schematic sectional view of the PR structure-type solar cell. First, a semiconductor substrate 101 is prepared. A single crystal or polycrystal silicon or the like is used for the semiconductor substrate 101. A conductivity type of the semiconductor substrate 101 may be either a p type or an n type. However, a p-type silicon substrate including a p-type semiconductor impurity such as boron and having specific resistance of 0. 1 to 4. 0 cm is often used. In the following explanation, a solar cell manufacturing method using the p-type silicon substrate is explained as an example. As the semiconductor substrate 101, a tabular semiconductor substrate having size of 100 to 150 mm square and thickness of 0. 05 to 0. 30 mm is suitably used. Subsequently, the semiconductor substrate 101 is immersed in, for example, an acid solution to remove damage to the surface of the semiconductor substrate 101 due to slicing or the like and then further chemically etched by an alkali solution such as a potassium hydroxide solution and cleaned and dried to form uneven structure called texture on both the surfaces of the substrate. The uneven structure causes multiple reflection of light on a solar cell light receiving surface. Therefore, by forming the uneven structure, reflectance effectively decreases and conversion efficiency is improved. Subsequently, a BSF Back Surface Field layer 104 is formed. The semiconductor substrate 101 is set in a high-temperature gas of 800 to 1100 C. including, for example, BBr3. A p-type diffusion layer and a glass layer having sheet resistance of 20 to 300 /square are formed on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate 101 by a thermal diffusion method for diffusing a p-type impurity element such as boron on the rear surface. In this case, by diffusing the p-type impurity element in a state in which light receiving surfaces of two semiconductor substrates 101 are opposed and superimposed during thermal diffusion, p-type diffusion layer formation on the light receiving surfaces can be prevented. Thereafter, by immersing the semiconductor substrate 101 in a chemical such as a diluted hydrofluoric acid solution, the glass layer formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate 101 during the diffusion is removed. The semiconductor substrate 101 is cleaned by pure water. Subsequently, an emitter layer 102 is formed. The semiconductor substrate 101 is set in a high-temperature gas of 850 to 1100 C. including, for example, POCl3. An n-type diffusion layer and a glass layer having sheet resistance of 30 to 300 /square are formed on the light receiving surface by a thermal diffusion method for diffusing an n-type impurity element such as phosphorus over the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate 101. The n-type diffusion layer becomes the emitter layer 102. Note that, when the n-type diffusion layer is formed by the thermal diffusion method, the n-type diffusion layer is sometimes formed on the rear surface and the edge face of the semiconductor substrate 101 as well. Even in this case, by diffusing the n-type impurity element in a state in which rear surfaces of two semiconductor substrates 101 are opposed and superimposed during thermal diffusion, n-type diffusion layer formation on the rear surfaces can be prevented. Thereafter, by immersing the semiconductor substrate 101 in a chemical such as a diluted hydrofluoric acid solution, the glass layer formed on the surface of the substrate during the diffusion is removed. The semiconductor substrate 101 is cleaned by pure water. The emitter layer 102 is formed after the BSF layer 104 is formed. However, the BSF layer 104 may be formed after the emitter layer 102 is formed. Subsequently, passivation films 103 and 106 used as antireflection films as well are respectively formed on the light receiving surface and the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate 101. The passivation films 103 and 106 are made of, for example, SiN silicon nitride and are formed by a plasma CVD method or the like for diluting, for example, a mixed gas of SiH4 and NH3 with N2, converting the mixed gas into plasma with glow discharge decomposition, and depositing the plasma. The passivation films 103 and 106 are formed to have a refractive index of approximately 1. 8 to 2. 3 considering, for example, a refractive index difference between the passivation films 103 and 106 and the semiconductor substrate 101. The passivation films 103 and 106 are formed at thickness of approximately 500 to 1000 angstrom. The passivation films 103 and 106 are provided to prevent light from reflecting on the surface of the semiconductor substrate 101 and effectively capturing the light into the semiconductor substrate 101. This SiN also functions as a passivation film having a passivation effect for the n-type diffusion layer in the formation and has an effect of improving an electric characteristic of the solar cell together with an antireflection function. This film is not limited to the silicon nitride. A single layer film of silicon oxide, silicon carbide, amorphous silicon, aluminum oxide, or titanium oxide or a laminated film obtained by combining silicon oxide, silicon carbide, amorphous silicon, aluminum oxide, and titanium oxide may be used. Different films may be used for the light receiving surface and the rear surface. Subsequently, conductive silver paste containing, for example, silver powder and glass frit is screen-printed on the light receiving surface and the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate 101 and is dried. Thereafter, the conductive paste on the light receiving surface and the rear surface is baked at temperature of approximately 500 C. to 950 C. for approximately 1 to 60 seconds to penetrate the passivation films 103 and 106, and an electrode formed by sintering the silver powder and the silicon are conducted to form electrodes 105 and 107. Note that the order of the electrode formation on the light receiving surface and the rear surface may be changed or the baking on the light receiving surface and the rear surface may be performed at a time. In the manufacturing method for the general PR structure-type solar cell explained above, the finger electrode and the bus bar electrode on the rear surface are formed by baking the conductive silver paste containing the silver powder, the glass frit, or the like. However, when the method explained above is used, an amount of use of the expensive conductive silver paste increases and adversely affects manufacturing cost. Moreover, there is a problem in that recombination rate between the electrodes 105 and 107 and the semiconductor substrate 101 greatly increases to prevent a conversion efficiency increase. These problems are solved by the present invention. Specifically, the finger electrode is formed by baking inexpensive conductive aluminum paste and the bus bar electrode is formed by heating low-temperature thermosetting silver paste. In this case, an intermediate layer formed by baking conductive silver paste is formed between the finger electrode and the bus bar electrode. Consequently, it is possible to electrically connect the finger electrode and the bus bar electrode while reducing carrier recombination of the bus bar electrode and a silicon substrate interface while reducing contact resistance and carrier recombination rate of the finger electrode and the silicon substrate interface. Therefore, it is possible to increase conversion efficiency while reducing manufacturing cost. PR Structure-Type Solar Cell 2 is a perspective view of the rear surface of a PR structure-type solar battery cell applied with the solar battery according to the present invention. The PR structure-type solar battery cell according to this embodiment is different from the general PR structure-type solar cell explained above in the structure of an electrode. The semiconductor substrate 101, the texture structure provided on the semiconductor substrate 101, the BSF layer 104, and the passivation films 103 and 106 are the same. A rear surface finger electrode 201 and a rear surface bus bar electrode 202 are provided on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate 101. A plurality of rear surface finger electrodes 201 are provided in parallel at predetermined intervals and connected to the semiconductor substrate 101. The rear surface bus bar electrode 202 is provided to intersect the plurality of rear surface finger electrodes 201. An intermediate layer 203 is provided between the rear surface finger electrode 201 and the rear surface bus bar electrode 202. In 2, for convenience of explanation, the intermediate layer 203 is drawn large. The intermediate layer 203 is provided in an intersecting position of the rear surface finger electrode 201 and the rear surface bus bar electrode 202. The rear surface finger electrode 201 and the rear surface bus bar electrode 202 are electrically connected to each other via the intermediate layer 203. That is, carriers generated from the solar cell are efficiently extracted to the rear surface bus bar electrode 202 via the intermediate layer 203 passing through the rear surface finger electrode 201. Manufacturing System for the PR Structure-Type Solar CellSubsequently, a solar cell manufacturing system 400 suitable for manufacturing of the PR structure-type solar cell explained above is explained. As shown in 3, the manufacturing system 400 for the PR structure-type solar cell at least includes a film forming apparatus 410 that forms a passivation film that protects a semiconductor substrate, a finger-electrode forming apparatus 420 that forms a first finger electrode connected to the semiconductor substrate on a main surface of the semiconductor substrate, an intermediate-layer forming apparatus 430 that forms an intermediate layer on the first finger electrode, and a bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 440 that forms a first bus bar electrode that intersects the first finger electrode via the intermediate layer. The film forming apparatus 410 can be, for example, a plasma CVD apparatus. When silicon oxide is used as the passivation film, the film forming apparatus 410 can be a heat treatment furnace capable of performing treatment in a clean atmosphere at temperature up to approximately 1000 C. The finger-electrode forming apparatus 420 can be, for example, an apparatus configured from a screen printing apparatus, a drying furnace, and a baking furnace. The finger-electrode forming apparatus 420 bakes conductive aluminum paste to form the first finger electrode. The intermediate-layer forming apparatus 430 can be, for example, an apparatus configured from a screen printing apparatus, a drying furnace, and a baking furnace. The intermediate-layer forming apparatus 430 bakes first conductive silver paste containing glass frit to form the intermediate layer. The baking furnace of the finger-electrode forming apparatus 420 and the baking furnace of the intermediate-layer forming apparatus 430 can be the same. Consequently, the conductive aluminum paste and the first conductive silver paste are simultaneously baked. Further, the finger-electrode forming apparatus 420 may also be used as one or more of the screen printing apparatus and the drying furnace of the intermediate-layer forming apparatus 430. The bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 440 can be, for example, an apparatus configured from a screen printing apparatus, a drying furnace, and a heating furnace. Depending on a temperature adjustable range of the drying furnace, the heating furnace is not always necessary. The bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 440 heats second conductive silver paste containing epoxy resin or acrylic resin to form the first bus bar electrode. A difference between a baking time peak temperature of the conductive aluminum paste and the first conductive silver paste and a heating time peak temperature of the second conductive silver paste can be set to 300 C. or more and 700 C. or less. The bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 440 may also be used as one or both of the screen printing apparatus and the drying furnace of the intermediate-layer forming apparatus 430. The screen printing apparatus at least includes a printing unit, an alignment unit, and a conveying unit. The printing unit includes a squeegee, a scraper, and a printing plate. The printing plate can be changed as appropriate according to a desired printing pattern. Paste on the printing plate is coated filled in a plate by the scraper and printed squeezed out from the plate to the substrate by the squeegee. The alignment unit includes an imaging device a camera, for recognizing a substrate position and a movable substrate stage and adjusts a printing position on the substrate to be always the same. The conveying unit passes the substrate to the printing stage and discharges the substrate. The drying furnace and the heating furnace may continuously treat the substrate with a conveying mechanism of a belt conveyor type, a walking beam type, or the like or may be a batch type for collectively performing heat treatment of a plurality of substrates in a furnace. The drying furnace and the heating furnace may be coupled to the screen printing apparatus and the baking furnace by, for example, interposing a conveying apparatus therebetween. As a treatment temperature, a range of a room temperature to approximately 400 C. can be desirably controlled. In general, the baking furnace continuously treats the substrate with the conveying mechanism of the belt conveyor type, the walking beam type, or the like. As a treatment temperature, a range of approximately 300 C. to 900 C. can be desirably controlled. With the manufacturing system 400 explained above, the finger electrode formed by baking the conductive aluminum paste and the bus bar electrode formed by heating the low-temperature thermosetting silver paste are electrically connected at low resistance. An inexpensive and highly efficient PR structure-type solar cell that achieves both of the aluminum electrode the finger electrode and the low-temperature thermosetting bus bar electrode can be manufactured. Back Contact Type Solar CellThe above explanation is an example of the embodiment concerning the PR structure-type solar cell. The present invention can also be applied to a back contact type solar cell in which both of an emitter layer and a BSF layer are formed on a non-light receiving surface. 4 is a perspective view of the rear surface of the back contact type solar cell applied with the solar cell according to the present invention. On the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate 101, a first finger electrode 301 connected to an emitter layer 305, a first bus bar electrode 302 that intersects the first finger electrode 301, and an intermediate layer 303 provided between the first finger electrode 301 and the first bus bar electrode 302 are provided. In 4, for convenience of explanation, the intermediate layer 303 is drawn large. On the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate 101, a second finger electrode 307 disposed alternately with the first finger electrode 301 and a second bus bar electrode 308 that intersects the second finger electrode 307 are provided. The second finger electrode 307 is connected to a BSF layer 304 provided on the rear surface of the semiconductor substrate 101. In such a back contact type solar cell, the first finger electrode 301 and the first bus bar electrode 302 are electrically connected to each other via the intermediate layer 303. That is, carriers generated from the solar cell are efficiently extracted to the first bus bar electrode 302 via the intermediate layer 303 passing through the first finger electrode 301. Manufacturing System for the Back Contact Type Solar CellSubsequently, a solar cell manufacturing system 500 suitable for manufacturing of the back contact type solar cell explained above is explained. As shown in 5, the manufacturing system 500 for the back contact type solar cell according to the present invention at least includes a diffusion-layer forming apparatus 510 that forms a first diffusion layer of a first conductivity type provided on a main surface of a semiconductor substrate and a second diffusion layer of a second conductivity type provided on the main surface, a film forming apparatus 520 that forms a passivation film that protects the semiconductor substrate, the first diffusion layer, and the second diffusion layer, a first-finger-electrode forming apparatus 530 that forms a first finger electrode connected to the first diffusion layer on the main surface, a second-finger-electrode forming apparatus 540 that forms a second finger electrode connected to the second diffusion layer on the main surface, an intermediate-layer forming apparatus 550 that forms an intermediate layer on the first finger electrode, a first-bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 560 that forms a first bus bar electrode that intersects the first finger electrode via the intermediate layer, and a second-bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 570 that forms a second bus bar electrode that intersects the second finger electrode. The diffusion-layer forming apparatus 510 can be, for example, a heat treatment furnace capable of performing treatment in a clean atmosphere at temperature up to approximately 1000 C. and capable of introducing a dopant gas such as BBr3 or POCl3. The film forming apparatus 520 can be, for example, a plasma CVD apparatus. When silicon oxide is used as the passivation film, the film forming apparatus 520 can also be a heat treatment furnace capable of performing treatment in a clean atmosphere at temperature up to approximately 1000 C. The first-finger-electrode forming apparatus 530 can be, for example, an apparatus configured from a screen printing apparatus, a drying furnace, and a baking furnace. The first-finger-electrode forming apparatus 530 bakes conductive aluminum paste to form the first finger electrode. The second-finger-electrode forming apparatus 540 can be, for example, an apparatus configured from a screen printing apparatus, a drying furnace, and a baking furnace. The second-finger-electrode forming apparatus 540 bakes first conductive silver paste containing glass frit to form the second finger electrode. The intermediate-layer forming apparatus 550 can be, for example, an apparatus configured from a screen printing apparatus, a drying furnace, and a baking furnace. The intermediate-layer forming apparatus 550 bakes second conductive silver paste containing glass frit to form the intermediate layer. The baking furnace of the first-finger-electrode forming apparatus 530 and the baking furnace of the second-finger-electrode forming apparatus 540 can be the same as the baking furnace of the intermediate-layer forming apparatus 550. Consequently, the first conductive silver paste, the second conductive silver paste, and the conductive aluminum paste are simultaneously baked. Further, the first-finger-electrode forming apparatus 530 and the second-finger-electrode forming apparatus 540 may also be used as one or more of the screen printing apparatus and the drying furnace of the intermediate-layer forming apparatus 550. The first-bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 560 and the second-bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 570 can be, for example, an apparatus configured from a screen printing apparatus, a drying furnace, and a heating furnace. Depending on a temperature adjustable range of the drying furnace, the heating furnace is not always necessary. The first-bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 560 heats third conductive silver paste containing epoxy resin or acrylic resin to form the first bus bar electrode. A difference between a baking time peak temperature of the first conductive silver paste, the second conductive silver paste, and the conductive aluminum paste and a heating time peak temperature of the third conductive silver paste can be set to 300 C. or more and 700 C. or less. The first-bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 560 and the second-bus-bar-electrode forming apparatus 570 may also be used as one or both of the screen printing apparatus and the drying furnace of the intermediate-layer forming apparatus 550. The screen printing apparatus at least includes a printing unit, an alignment unit, and a conveying unit. The printing unit includes a squeegee, a scraper, and a printing plate. The printing plate can be changed as appropriate according to a desired printing pattern. Paste on the printing plate is coated filled in a plate by the scraper and printed squeezed out from the plate to the substrate by the squeegee. The alignment unit includes an imaging device a camera, for recognizing a substrate position and a movable substrate stage and adjusts a printing position on the substrate to be always the same. The conveying unit passes the substrate to the printing stage and discharges the substrate. The drying furnace and the heating furnace may continuously treat the substrate with a conveying mechanism of a belt conveyor type, a walking beam type, or the like or may be a batch type for collectively performing heat treatment of a plurality of substrates in a furnace. The drying furnace and the heating furnace may be coupled to the screen printing apparatus and the baking furnace by, for example, interposing a conveying apparatus therebetween. As a treatment temperature, a range of a room temperature to approximately 400 C. can be desirably controlled. In general, the baking furnace continuously treats the substrate with the conveying mechanism of the belt conveyor type, the walking beam type, or the like. As a treatment temperature, a range of approximately 300 C. to 900 C. can be desirably controlled. With the manufacturing system 500 explained above, the finger electrode formed by baking the conductive aluminum paste and the bus bar electrode formed by heating the low-temperature thermosetting silver paste are electrically connected at low resistance. An inexpensive and highly efficient back electrode-type solar cell that achieves both of the aluminum electrode the finger electrode and the low-temperature thermosetting bus bar electrode can be manufactured.",

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Stem cells, such as human embryonic stem cells hESCs or human induced pluripotent stem cells hiPSCs, are self-renewing pluripotent cells that are able to differentiate into many cell types in the body. They hold great promises for cell therapy, drug research and tissue engineering. Further, it is envisioned that in the future human induced pluripotent stem cells, multipotent cells and other undifferentiated cells will be proliferated and directed to differentiate into specific lineages so as to develop differentiated cells or tissues which can be transplanted into human bodies for therapeutic purposes. Human pluripotent stem cells and the differentiated cells that may be derived from them are also powerful scientific tools for studying human cellular and developmental systems. The medical applications of cell-based therapies are rapidly increasing. Therefore it is desired to develop systems that enable the storage and transportation of cell therapy products from manufacture site to site of use. Freezing and thawing the cells may damage the cells, lower the amount of viable cells, and is time consuming, complex and expensive. There is need for simpler and inexpensive methods for storing cells for a shorter term, for example during transportation.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "In the present invention it was found out that cells, especially stem cells, can be stored in a nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel at hypothermic temperatures for several days. This can be used for stabilizing the cells for transportation. Herein it is disclosed how to use the nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel as a matrix for the cells. The matrix provides support for the cells, but it also provides cytoprotective properties, i. e. conditions where the cells remain stable and viable. In general hypothermic storage may induce adverse effects to the cells, for example hypoxic stress, ischemia and reperfusion injury, disruptions in membrane potential redox balance, cellular ionic imbalances such as disturbance of Na+, Ca2+, and Fe2+ homeostasis, generation of reactive oxygen species, collapse of cytoskeleton, and ultrastructural damage. Especially increased hypothermic storage intervals may result in the activation of necrotic or apoptosis cell death pathways. The solutions presented in this disclosure aim to prevent or alleviate these negative effects. The present disclosure provides a cell system comprising eukaryotic cells in a hydrogel comprising nanofibrillar cellulose in cell storage medium at a temperature in the range of 0-25 C. The present disclosure also provides a method for storing eukaryotic cells, the method comprising providing eukaryotic cells, providing nanofibrillar cellulose, providing cell storage medium, combining the cells, the nanofibrillar cellulose and the cell storage medium to form a cell system, and storing the cell system at a temperature in the range of 0-25 C. The temperatures used for storing and/or transporting the cells are hypothermic temperatures, which may include ambient temperatures. Hypothermic temperatures as used herein may refer to temperatures which are lower than a body temperature or a temperature used for culturing cells. Hypothermic temperature may refer to a temperature below 37 C. , or 30 C. or below, or 25 C. or below, or even lower temperature. However temperatures below 0 C. are not required, which prevents damaging the cells by freezing. As no freezing is carried out, the process is simpler and does not require specific freezing equipment, thawing or for example use of liquid nitrogen. Also no cryoprotectants or lyoprotectants are needed. The cells and the materials are not dried, such as lyophilized, so they do not need to be rehydrated. When using the hypothermic temperatures the cells remain viable and may be used immediately after releasing from the matrix, or already when bound to the matrix, for example to enable quality control testing. The cells may enter pause state, which helps maintaining them in the cell system, especially maintaining them at a desired state. The present disclosure also provides a method for providing eukaryotic cells, the method comprising providing the cell system, and extracting the cells from the hydrogel, such as by enzymatically digesting the hydrogel or by diluting the hydrogel, to provide the cells. The main embodiments are characterized in the independent claims. Various embodiments are disclosed in the dependent claims. The embodiments and examples recited in the claims and the specification are mutually freely combinable unless otherwise explicitly stated. The formed cell system enables obtaining a scalable, reproducible and cost-effective cell storage system, wherefrom the cells may be easily released and harvested. The formed cell system also enables providing a composition for storing cells in an undifferentiated state, i. e. to prevent spontaneous or induced differentiation of cells, especially stem cells. Also the proliferation of the cells may be paused or substantially decreased. For example maintaining stem cells in pluripotent or multipotent state is demanding and requires careful control of storing conditions, materials and handling of the cells. The nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel provides a hydrophilic matrix, which is non-toxic, biocompatible and also biodegradable. The matrix can be degraded enzymatically, for example by adding cellulase. On the other hand the hydrogel is stable at physiological conditions, and does not need to be crosslinked by using additional agents. It is also possible to dilute the hydrogel, for example to obtain a dispersion which is no longer in a gel state, which may enable releasing and harvesting the cells, for example by centrifuging or filtering. Use of reactive agents can be avoided, which agents could affect the cells. Cells, especially challenging and/or sensitive cells, can be stored and transported in protective nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogels, and recovered to obtain viable cells. The feature that the hydrogel can be enzymatically digested is advantageous, especially is the case of stem cells. When a cell system is paused, its biological clock stops; similarly, when frozen. Therefore, a completely new generation of just-add-water cell products can be provided, where the supportive NFC matrix can be removed after transportation. This may in return accelerate the cell research, as the research typically requires a lot of currently irreplaceable handwork. Also, transporting and storing ready-to-use cell systems is more affordable, as complex cooling systems would not be required. For example 3D cultivated cell spheroid products can be made directly accessible to researchers without the requirement to seed and grow them first. As 3D spheroids better mimic real tumors, particularly for example if hypoxia is considered, their usage will likely increase in the near future. Later, clinical applications for the cell products can be considered in a more serious manner. Certain advantageous properties of the hydrogel comprising nanofibrillar cellulose include flexibility, elasticity and remouldability. As the hydrogel contains a lot of water, it may also show good permeability. The hydrogels of the embodiments also provide high water retention capacity and molecule diffusion property speedThe hydrogels described herein are useful in medical and scientific applications, wherein the materials comprising nanofibrillar cellulose are in contact with living matter. The products containing nanofibrillar cellulose as described herein are highly biocompatible with the living matter and provide several advantageous effects. Without binding to any specific theory, it is believed that a hydrogel comprising very hydrophilic nanofibrillar cellulose having a very high specific surface area, and thus high water retention ability, when applied against cells and/or tissue, provides favourable moist environment between the cells and/or tissue and the hydrogel comprising nanofibrillar cellulose. The high amount of free hydroxyl groups in the nanofibrillar cellulose forms hydrogen bonds between the nanofibrillar cellulose and water molecules and enables gel formation and the high water retention ability of the nanofibrillar cellulose. Because of the high amount of water in the nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel, only water is supposed to be in contact with cells or tissue, and which also enables migration of fluids and/or agents if necessary. The nanofibrillar cellulose used as a matrix for the cells provides an environment, which protects the cells and helps them maintain their viability at challenging conditions, for example when nutrients are not available. One advantage of the nanofibrillar cellulose material is that the dimensions of the fibrillar network of cellulose nanofibers is very close to natural ECM network of collagen nanofibers. Furthermore, cellulose nanofiber is non-animal based material, so there is no risk for disease transfer. Currently, most of the commercial products are isolated from animals. With the present materials it is possible to obtain a transparent and porous matrix for the cells, and the handling of the material is easy compared to the alternatives. Cellulose nanofibers have negligible fluorescence background. Cellulose nanofiber hydrogel has optimal elasticity, stiffness, shear stress, mechanical adhesion and porosity to be used as 3D and 2D cell storage matrix.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "In this specification, percentage values, unless specifically indicated otherwise, are based on weight w/w.

CellsIn the present methods and products, cells are provided. The cells may be prokaryotic cells, such as bacterial cells, or they may be eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells may be plant cells, yeast cells or animal cells. Examples of eukaryotic cells include transplantable cells, such as stem cells. The cells may be animal cells or human cells. Specific examples of cells include stem cells, undifferentiated cells, precursor cells, as well as fully differentiated cells and combinations thereof. In some examples the cells comprise cell types selected from the group consisting of keratocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblast cells, epithelial cells and combinations thereof. In some examples the cells are selected from the group consisting of stem cells, progenitor cells, precursor cells, connective tissue cells, epithelial cells, muscle cells, neuronal cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, stromal cells, mesenchymal cells, immune system cells, hematopoietic cells, dendritic cells, hair follicle cells and combinations thereof. The cells may be tumor or cancer cells, genetically modified cells, such as transgenic cells, cisgenic cells or knock-out cells, or pathogenic cells. Such cells may be used for example for drug research or in therapy. Especially stem cells may be used in therapeutical applications, for example provided to a patient. In one embodiment the cells are eukaryotic cells, such as mammalian cells. Examples of mammalian cells include human cells, mouse cells, rat cells, rabbit cells, monkey cells, pig cells, bovine cells, chicken cells and the like. It is to be noted that even though the advantages of the present methods and products are best demonstrated for storing mammalian cells, the methods and products may be also used for storing other cells, such as non-mammalian eukaryotic cells, yeast cells, or prokaryotic cells. In one embodiment the cells are stem cells, such as omnipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent or unipotent stem cells. Stem cells are cells capable of renewing themselves through cell division and can differentiate into multi-lineage cells. These cells may be categorized as embryonic stem cells ESCs, induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs, and adult stem cells, also called as tissue-specific or somatic stem cells. The stem cells may be human stem cells, which may be of non-embryonic origin, such as adult stem cells. These are undifferentiated cells found throughout the body after differentiation. They are responsible for organ regeneration and capable of dividing in pluripotent or multipotent state and differentiating into differentiated cell lineages. The stem cells may be human embryonic stem cell lines generated without embryo destruction, such as described for example in Cell Stem Cell. 2008 Feb. 7; 22:113-7. The stem cells may be obtained from a source of autologous adult stem cells, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, or blood. Examples of stem cells include mesenchymal stem cells MSC, multipotent adult progenitor cells MAPCO, induced pluripotent stem cells iPS, and hematopoietic stem cells. In case of human stem cells the cells may be non-embryonic cells or cells, such as hESCs, which can be derived without destroying the embryo. In case of human embryonic stem cells the cells may be from a deposited cell line or made from unfertilized eggs, i. e. parthenote eggs or from parthenogenetically activated ovum, so that no human embryos are destroyed. In one embodiment the cells are mesenchymal stem cells MSC. Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs are adult stem cells which can be isolated from human and animal sources, such as from mammals. Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent stromal cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes and adipocytes. Mesenchyme itself is embryonic connective tissue that is derived from the mesoderm and that differentiates into hematopoietic and connective tissue. However mesenchymal stem cells do not differentiate into hematopoietic cells. The terms mesenchymal stem cell and marrow stromal cell have been used interchangeably for many years, but neither term is sufficiently descriptive. Stromal cells are connective tissue cells that form the supportive structure in which the functional cells of the tissue reside. While this is an accurate description for one function of MSCs, the term fails to convey the relatively recently discovered roles of MSCs in the repair of tissue. The term encompasses multipotent cells derived from other non-marrow tissues, such as placenta, umbilical cord blood, adipose tissue, adult muscle, corneal stroma or the dental pulp of deciduous baby teeth. The cells do not have the capacity to reconstitute an entire organThe International Society for Cellular Therapy has proposed minimum criteria to define MSCs. These cells a should exhibits plastic adherence, b possess specific set of cell surface markers, i. e. cluster of differentiation CD73, D90, CD105 and lack expression of CD14, CD34, CD45 and human leucocyte antigen-DR HLA-DR and c have the ability to differentiate in vitro into adipocyte, chondrocyte and osteoblast. These characteristics are valid for all MSCs, although few differences exist in MSCs isolated from various tissue origins. MSCs are present not only in fetal tissues but also in many adult tissues with few exceptions. Efficient population of MSCs has been reported from bone marrow. Cells which exhibits characteristics of MSCs have been isolated from adipose tissue, amniotic fluid, amniotic membrane, dental tissues, endometrium, limb bud, menstrual blood, peripheral blood, placenta and fetal membrane, salivary gland, skin and foreskin, sub-amniotic umbilical cord lining membrane, synovial fluid and Wharton's jelly. Human mesenchymal stem cells hMSC display a very high degree of plasticity and are found in virtually all organs with the highest density in bone marrow. hMSCs serve as renewable source for mesenchymal cells and have pluripotent ability of differentiating into several cell lineages, including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, skeletal and cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells, and neurons in vitro upon appropriate stimulation, and in vivo after transplantation. In one example the cells are multipotent adult progenitor cells MAPC, which are derived from a primitive cell population that can be harvested from bone marrow, muscle and brain. MAPC are a more primitive cell population than mesenchymal stem cells, whilst they imitate embryonic stem cells characteristics they still retain adult stem cells potential in cell therapy. In vitro, MAPC demonstrated a vast differentiation potential to adipogenic, osteogenic, neurogenic, hepatogenic, hematopoietic, myogenic, chondrogenic, epithelial, and endothelial lineages. A key feature of MAPC is that they show large proliferative potential in vitro without losing their phenotype. MAPC may be used for treating a variety of diseases such as ischaemic stroke, graft versus host disease, acute myocardial infarct, organ transplant, bone repair and myelodysplasia. MAPC also enhance bone formation, promote neovascularisation, and have immunomodulatory effects. Induced pluripotent stem cells iPS are a type of pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from adult cells. They can propagate practically indefinitely and may give rise to every other cell type in the body, including neurons, heart, pancreatic and liver cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells can be derived directly from adult tissues and they can be made in a patient-matched manner so they may be provided a transplants without the risk of immune rejection. Human induced pluripotent stem cells are of special interest, and they can be generated from for example human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, peripheral blood cells, renal epithelial cells or other suitable cell types. Hematopoietic stem cells HSCs, also called as blood stem cells, are cells that can develop into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Hematopoietic stem cells are found in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow. HSCs give rise to both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages of blood cells. Myeloid and lymphoid lineages both are involved in dendritic cell formation. Myeloid cells include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes to platelets. Lymphoid cells include T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Hematopoietic stem cell transplants can be used in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders. In general the cells may be cultured in a hydrogel, and they may be also stored in it. The cells can be maintained and proliferated on or in the hydrogel without animal or human based agents or medium originating outside the cells. The cells may be evenly dispersed on or in the hydrogel. Initially the cells may be pre-cultured in a separate culture, and recovered and transferred into a new medium, which may be similar or different than the culture medium. A cell suspension is obtained. This, or another cell suspension, may be combined and/or mixed with the nanofibrillar cellulose, such as a hydrogel comprising nanofibrillar cellulose, to obtain or form a cell system. If cells are cultured in the cell system a cell culture is formed. The cell system or culture may be 2D system or culture or a 3D system or culture. 2D system or culture refers to a system or culture in a membrane and/or as a layer. 3D system or culture refers to a system or culture in the nanofibrillar cellulose, wherein the cells are permitted to grow and/or interact in all three dimensions. The NFC hydrogel matrix mimics the natural extracellular matrix structure and provides efficient transport of nutrients, gases and the like. In one example the cell system is a 3D cell system. Nanofibrillar CelluloseThe starting material for forming the cell system is nanofibrillar cellulose, also called as nanocellulose, which refers to isolated cellulose fibrils or fibril bundles derived from cellulose raw material. Nanofibrillar cellulose is based on a natural polymer that is abundant in nature. Nanofibrillar cellulose has a capability of forming viscous hydrogel in water. Nanofibrillar cellulose production techniques may be based on disintegrating fibrous raw material, such as grinding of aqueous dispersion of pulp fibers to obtain nanofibrillated cellulose. After the grinding or homogenization process, the obtained nanofibrillar cellulose material is a dilute viscoelastic hydrogel. The obtained material usually exists at a relatively low concentration homogeneously distributed in water due to the disintegration conditions. The starting material may be an aqueous gel at a concentration of 0. 2-10% w/w, for example 0. 2-5% w/w. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be obtained directly from the disintegration of fibrous raw material. Because of its nanoscale structure nanofibrillar cellulose has unique properties which enable functionalities which cannot be provided by conventional cellulose. However, because of the nanoscale structure nanofibrillar cellulose is also a challenging material. For example dewatering or handling of nanofibrillar cellulose may be difficult. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be prepared from cellulose raw material of plant origin, or it may also be derived from certain bacterial fermentation processes. The nanofibrillar cellulose is preferably made of plant material. The raw material may be based on any plant material that contains cellulose. In one example the fibrils are obtained from non-parenchymal plant material. In such case the fibrils may be obtained from secondary cell walls. One abundant source of such cellulose fibrils is wood fibres. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be manufactured by homogenizing wood-derived fibrous raw material, which may be chemical pulp. Cellulose fibers are disintegrated to produce fibrils which have an average diameter of only some nanometers, which may be 200 nm or less in most cases, and gives a dispersion of fibrils in water. The fibrils originating from secondary cell walls are essentially crystalline with degree of crystallinity of at least 55%. Such fibrils may have different properties than fibrils originated from primary cell walls, for example the dewatering of fibrils originating from secondary cell walls may be more challenging. In general in the cellulose sources from primary cell walls, such as sugar beet, potato tuber and banana rachis, the microfibrils are easier to liberate from the fibre matrix than fibrils from wood, and the disintegration requires less energy. However, these materials are still somewhat heterogeneous and consist of large fibril bundles. Non-wood material may be from agricultural residues, grasses or other plant substances such as straw, leaves, bark, seeds, hulls, flowers, vegetables or fruits from cotton, corn, wheat, oat, rye, barley, rice, flax, hemp, manila hemp, sisal hemp, jute, ramie, kenaf, bagasse, bamboo or reed. The cellulose raw material could be also derived from the cellulose-producing micro-organism. The micro-organisms can be of the genus Acetobacter, Agrobacterium, Rhizobium, Pseudomonasor Alcaligenes, preferably of the genus Acetobacter and more preferably of the species Acetobacter xylinumor or Acetobacter pasteurianus. It was found out that nanofibrillar cellulose obtained from wood cellulose is preferable for medical or scientific products described herein. Wood cellulose is available in large amounts, and the preparation methods developed for wood cellulose enable producing nanofibrillar materials suitable for the products. The nanofibrillar cellulose obtained by fibrillating plant fibers, especially wood fibers, differs structurally from nanofibrillar cellulose obtained from microbes, and it has different properties. For example compared to bacterial cellulose, nanofibrillated wood cellulose is homogenous and more porous and loose material, which is advantageous in applications involving living cells. Bacterial cellulose is usually used as such without similar fibrillation as in plant cellulose, so the material is different. Bacterial cellulose is dense material which easily forms small spheroids and therefore the structure of the material is discontinuous, and it is not desired to use such material in the applications relating to living cells. Wood may be from softwood tree such as spruce, pine, fir, larch, douglas-fir or hemlock, or from hardwood tree such as birch, aspen, poplar, alder, eucalyptus, oak, beech or acacia, or from a mixture of softwoods and hardwoods. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose is obtained from wood pulp. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be obtained from hardwood pulp. In one example the hardwood is birch. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be obtained from softwood pulp. In one example said wood pulp is chemical pulp. Chemical pulp may be desired for the products. Chemical pulp is pure material and may be used in a wide variety of applications. For example chemical pulp lack the pitch and resin acids present in mechanical pulp, and it is more sterile or easily sterilisable. Further, chemical pulp is more flexible and provides advantageous properties for example in medical materials, membranes, patches, dressings and other materials, which may be applied on living tissue. As used herein, the term nanofibrillar cellulose refers to cellulose fibrils and/or fibril bundles separated from cellulose-based fiber raw material. These fibrils are characterized by a high aspect ratio length/diameter. The average length of nanofibrillar cellulose the median length of particles such as fibrils or fibril bundles may exceed 1 m, and in most cases it is 50 m or less. If the elementary fibrils are not completely separated from each other, the entangled fibrils may have an average total length for example in the range of 1-100 m, 1-50 m, or 1-20 m. However, if the nanofibrillar material is highly fibrillated, the elementary fibrils may be completely or almost completely separated and the average fibril length is shorter, such as in the range of 1-10 m or 1-5 m. This applies especially for native grades of fibrils which are not shortened or digested, for example chemically, enzymatically or mechanically. However, strongly derivatized nanofibrillar cellulose may have a shorter average fibril length, such as in the range of 0. 3-50 m, such as 0. 3-20 m, for example 0. 5-10 m or 1-10 m. Especially shortened fibrils, such as enzymatically or chemically digested fibrils, or mechanically treated material, may have an average fibril length of less than 1 m, such as 0. 1-1 m, 0. 2-0. 8 m or 0. 4-0. 6 m. The fibril length and/or diameter may be estimated microscopically, for example using CRYO-TEM, SEM or AFM images. The average diameter width of nanofibrillar cellulose is less than 1 m, or 500 nm or less, such as in the range of 1-500 nm, but preferably 200 nm or less, even 100 nm or less or 50 nm or less, such as in the range of 1-200 nm, 2-200 nm, 2-100 nm, or 2-50 nm, even 2-20 for highly fibrillated material. The diameters disclosed herein may refer to fibrils and/or fibril bundles. The smallest fibrils are in the scale of elementary fibrils, the average diameter being typically in the range of 2-12 nm. The dimensions and size distribution of the fibrils depend on the refining method and efficiency. In case of highly refined native nanofibrillar cellulose, the average diameter of a fibril may be in the range of 2-200 nm or 5-100 nm, for example in the range of 10-50 nm. Nanofibrillar cellulose is characterized by a large specific surface area and a strong ability to form hydrogen bonds. In water dispersion, the nanofibrillar cellulose typically appears as either light or turbid gel-like material. Depending on the fiber raw material, nanofibrillar cellulose obtained from plants, especially wood, may also contain small amounts of other plant components, especially wood components, such as hemicellulose or lignin. The amount is dependent on the plant source. In general cellulose nanomaterials may be divided into categories according to TAPPI W13021, which provides standard terms for cellulose nanomaterials. Not all of these materials are nanofibrillar cellulose. Two main categories are Nano objects and Nano structured materials. Nanostructured materials include Cellulose microcrystals sometimes called as CMC having a diameter of 10-12 m and length:diameter ratio L/D&lt;2, and Cellulose microfibrils having a diameter of 10-100 nm and a length of 0. 5-50 m. Nano objects include Cellulose nanofibers, which can be divided into Cellulose nanocrystals CNC having a diameter of 3-10 nm and L/D&gt;5, and Cellulose nanofibrils CNF or NFC, having a diameter of 5-30 nm and L/D&gt;50. Different grades of nanofibrillar cellulose may be categorized based on three main properties: i size distribution, length and diameter ii chemical composition, and iii rheological properties. To fully describe a grade, the properties may be used in parallel. Examples of different grades include native or non-modified NFC, oxidized NFC high viscosity, oxidized NFC low viscosity, carboxymethylated NFC and cationized NFC. Within these main grades, also sub-grades exist, for example: extremely well fibrillated vs. moderately fibrillated, high degree of substitution vs. low degree of substitution, low viscosity vs. high viscosity etc. The fibrillation technique and the chemical pre-modification have an influence on the fibril size distribution. Typically, non-ionic grades have wider average fibril diameter for example in the range of 10-100 nm, or 10-50 nm while the chemically modified grades are a lot thinner for example in the range of 2-20 nm. Distribution is also narrower for the modified grades. Certain modifications, especially TEMPO-oxidation, yield shorter fibrils. Depending on the raw material source, hardwood vs. softwood pulp, different polysaccharide composition exists in the final nanofibrillar cellulose product. Commonly, the non-ionic grades are prepared from bleached birch pulp, which yields high xylene content 25% by weight. Modified grades are prepared either from hardwood or softwood pulps. In those modified grades, the hemicelluloses are also modified together with the cellulose domain. Most probably, the modification is not homogeneous, i. e. some parts are more modified than others. Thus, detailed chemical analysis is usually not possible as the modified products are complicated mixtures of different polysaccharide structures. In an aqueous environment, a dispersion of cellulose nanofibers forms a viscoelastic hydrogel network. The gel is formed already at relatively low concentrations of for example 0. 05-0. 2% w/w by dispersed and hydrated entangled fibrils. The viscoelasticity of the NFC hydrogel may be characterized for example with dynamic oscillatory rheological measurements. The nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogels exhibit characteristic rheological properties. For example they are shear-thinning or pseudoplastic materials, which means that their viscosity depends on the speed or force by which the material is deformed. When measuring the viscosity in a rotational rheometer, the shear-thinning behavior is seen as a decrease in viscosity with increasing shear rate. The hydrogels show plastic behavior, which means that a certain shear stress force is required before the material starts to flow readily. This critical shear stress is often called the yield stress. The yield stress can be determined from a steady state flow curve measured with a stress controlled rheometer. When the viscosity is plotted as function of applied shear stress, a dramatic decrease in viscosity is seen after exceeding the critical shear stress. The zero shear viscosity and the yield stress are the most important rheological parameters to describe the suspending power of the materials. These two parameters separate the different grades quite clearly and thus enable classification of the grades. The dimensions of the fibrils or fibril bundles are dependent for example on the raw material, the disintegration method and number of disintegration runs. Mechanical disintegration of the cellulose raw material may be carried out with any suitable equipment such as a refiner, grinder, disperser, homogenizer, colloider, friction grinder, pin mill, rotor-rotor dispergator, ultrasound sonicator, fluidizer such as microfluidizer, macrofluidizer or fluidizer-type homogenizer. The disintegration treatment is performed at conditions wherein water is sufficiently present to prevent the formation of bonds between the fibers. In one example the disintegration is carried out by using a disperser having at least one rotor, blade or similar moving mechanical member, such as a rotor-rotor dispergator, which has at least two rotors. In a disperser the fiber material in dispersion is repeatedly impacted by blades or ribs of rotors striking it from opposite directions when the blades rotate at the rotating speed and at the peripheral speed determined by the radius distance to the rotation axis in opposite directions. Because the fiber material is transferred outwards in the radial direction, it crashes onto the wide surfaces of the blades, i. e. ribs, coming one after the other at a high peripheral speed from opposite directions; in other words, it receives a plurality of successive impacts from opposite directions. Also, at the edges of the wide surfaces of the blades, i. e. ribs, which edges form a blade gap with the opposite edge of the next rotor blade, shear forces occur, which contribute to the disintegration of the fibers and detachment of fibrils. The impact frequency is determined by the rotation speed of the rotors, the number of the rotors, the number of blades in each rotor, and the flow rate of the dispersion through the device. In a rotor-rotor dispergator the fiber material is introduced through counter-rotating rotors, outwards in the radial direction with respect to the axis of rotation of the rotors in such a way that the material is repeatedly subjected to shear and impact forces by the effect of the different counter-rotating rotors, whereby it is simultaneously fibrillated. One example of a rotor-rotor dispergator is an Atrex device. Another example of a device suitable for disintegrating is a pin mill, such as a multi-peripheral pin mill. One example of such device includes a housing and in it a first rotor equipped with collision surfaces; a second rotor concentric with the first rotor and equipped with collision surfaces, the second rotor being arranged to rotate in a direction opposite to the first rotor; or a stator concentric with the first rotor and equipped with collision surfaces. The device includes a feed orifice in the housing and opening to the center of the rotors or the rotor and stator, and a discharge orifice on the housing wall and opening to the periphery of the outermost rotor or stator. In one example the disintegrating is carried out by using a homogenizer. In a homogenizer the fiber material is subjected to homogenization by an effect of pressure. The homogenization of the fiber material dispersion to nanofibrillar cellulose is caused by forced through-flow of the dispersion, which disintegrates the material to fibrils. The fiber material dispersion is passed at a given pressure through a narrow through-flow gap where an increase in the linear velocity of the dispersion causes shearing and impact forces on the dispersion, resulting in the removal of fibrils from the fiber material. The fiber fragments are disintegrated into fibrils in the fibrillating step. As used herein, the term fibrillation generally refers to disintegrating fiber material mechanically by work applied to the particles, where cellulose fibrils are detached from the fibers or fiber fragments. The work may be based on various effects, like grinding, crushing or shearing, or a combination of these, or another corresponding action that reduces the particle size. The expressions disintegration or disintegration treatment may be used interchangeably with fibrillation. The fiber material dispersion that is subjected to fibrillation is a mixture of fiber material and water, also herein called pulp. The fiber material dispersion may refer generally to whole fibers, parts fragments separated from them, fibril bundles, or fibrils mixed with water, and typically the aqueous fiber material dispersion is a mixture of such elements, in which the ratios between the components are dependent on the degree of processing or on the treatment stage, for example number of runs or passes through the treatment of the same batch of fiber material. One way to characterize the nanofibrillar cellulose is to use the viscosity of an aqueous solution containing said nanofibrillar cellulose. The viscosity may be for example Brookfield viscosity or zero shear viscosity. The specific viscosity, as described herein, distinguishes nanofibrillar cellulose from non-nanofibrillar cellulose. In one example the apparent viscosity of the nanofibrillar cellulose is measured with a Brookfield viscometer Brookfield viscosity or another corresponding apparatus. Suitably a vane spindle number 73 is used. There are several commercial Brookfield viscometers available for measuring apparent viscosity, which all are based on the same principle. Suitably RVDV spring Brookfield RVDV-III is used in the apparatus. A sample of the nanofibrillar cellulose is diluted to a concentration of 0. 8% by weight in water and mixed for 10 min. The diluted sample mass is added to a 250 ml beaker and the temperature is adjusted to 20 C. 1 C. , heated if necessary and mixed. A low rotational speed 10 rpm is used. In general Brookfield viscosity may be measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. The nanofibrillar cellulose provided as a starting material in the method may be characterized by the viscosity it provides in a water solution. The viscosity describes, for example, the fibrillation degree of the nanofibrillar cellulose. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose when dispersed in water provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 2000 mPas, such as at least 3000 mPas, measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose, when dispersed in water, provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 10000 mPas measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose, when dispersed in water, provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 15000 mPas measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. Examples of Brookfield viscosity ranges of said nanofibrillar cellulose when dispersed in water include 2000-20000 mPas, 3000-20000 mPas, 10000-20000 mPas, 15000-20000 mPas, 2000-25000 mPas, 3000-25000 mPas, 10000-25000 mPas, 15000-25000 mPas, 2000-30000 mPas, 3000-30000 mPas, 10000-30000 mPas, and 15000-30000 mPas, measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. Nanofibrillar cellulose may be or comprise non-modified nanofibrillar cellulose. The drainage of non-modified nanofibrillar cellulose is significantly faster than for example anionic grade. Non-modified nanofibrillar cellulose generally has a Brookfield viscosity in the range of 2000-10000 mPas, measured at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. However, in the present methods non-modified nanofibrillar cellulose does not crosslink efficiently because it contains a low amount of free carboxylic groups required for the crosslinking with the multivalent ions. It is preferred that the nanofibrillar cellulose has a suitable carboxylic acid content, such as in the range of 0. 6-1. 4 mmol COOH/g, for example in the range of 0. 7-1. 2 mmol COOH/g, or in the range of 0. 7-1. 0 mmol COOH/g or 0. 8-1. 2 mmol COOH/g, determined by conductometric titration. The disintegrated fibrous cellulosic raw material may be modified fibrous raw material. Modified fibrous raw material means raw material where the fibers are affected by the treatment so that cellulose nanofibrils are more easily detachable from the fibers. The modification is usually performed to fibrous cellulosic raw material which exists as a suspension in a liquid, i. e. pulp. The modification treatment to the fibers may be chemical, enzymatic or physical. In chemical modification the chemical structure of cellulose molecule is changed by chemical reaction derivatization of cellulose, preferably so that the length of the cellulose molecule is not affected but functional groups are added to -D-glucopyranose units of the polymer. The chemical modification of cellulose takes place at a certain conversion degree, which is dependent on the dosage of reactants and the reaction conditions, and as a rule it is not complete so that the cellulose will stay in solid form as fibrils and does not dissolve in water. In physical modification anionic, cationic, or non-ionic substances or any combination of these are physically adsorbed on cellulose surface. The cellulose in the fibers may be especially ionically charged after the modification. The ionic charge of the cellulose weakens the internal bonds of the fibers and will later facilitate the disintegration to nanofibrillar cellulose. The ionic charge may be achieved by chemical or physical modification of the cellulose. The fibers may have higher anionic or cationic charge after the modification compared with the starting raw material. Most commonly used chemical modification methods for making an anionic charge are oxidation, where hydroxyl groups are oxidized to aldehydes and carboxyl groups, sulphonization and carboxymethylation. Chemical modifications introducing groups, such as carboxyl groups, which may take part in forming a covalent bond between the nanofibrillar cellulose and the bioactive molecule, may be desired. A cationic charge in turn may be created chemically by cationization by attaching a cationic group to the cellulose, such as quaternary ammonium group. Nanofibrillar cellulose may comprise chemically modified nanofibrillar cellulose, such as anionically modified nanofibrillar cellulose or cationically modified nanofibrillar cellulose. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose is anionically modified nanofibrillar cellulose. In one example the anionically modified nanofibrillar cellulose is oxidized nanofibrillar cellulose. In one example the anionically modified nanofibrillar cellulose is sulphonized nanofibrillar cellulose. In one example the anionically modified nanofibrillar cellulose is carboxymethylated nanofibrillar cellulose. The material obtained with the anionical modification of cellulose may be called anionic cellulose, which refers to material wherein the amount or proportion of anionic groups, such as carboxylic groups, is increased by the modification, when compared to a non-modified material. It is also possible to introduce other anionic groups to the cellulose, instead or in addition to carboxylic groups, such as phosphate groups or sulphate groups. The content of these groups may be in the same ranges as is disclosed for carboxylic acid herein. The cellulose may be oxidized. In the oxidation of cellulose, the primary hydroxyl groups of cellulose may be oxidized catalytically by a heterocyclic nitroxyl compound, such as through N-oxyl mediated catalytic oxidation, for example 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy free radical, generally called TEMPO. The primary hydroxyl groups C6-hydroxyl groups of the cellulosic -D-glucopyranose units are selectively oxidized to carboxylic groups. Some aldehyde groups are also formed from the primary hydroxyl groups. Regarding the finding that low degree of oxidation does not allow efficient enough fibrillation and higher degree of oxidation inflicts degradation of cellulose after mechanical disruptive treatment, the cellulose may be oxidized to a level having a carboxylic acid content in the oxidized cellulose in the range of 0. 5-2. 0 mmol COOH/g pulp, 0. 6-1. 4 mmol COOH/g pulp, or 0. 8-1. 2 mmol COOH/g pulp, preferably to 1. 0-1. 2 mmol COOH/g pulp, determined by conductometric titration. When the fibers of oxidized cellulose so obtained are disintegrated in water, they give stable transparent dispersion of individualized cellulose fibrils, which may be, for example, of 3-5 nm in width. With oxidized pulp as the starting medium, it is possible to obtain nanofibrillar cellulose where Brookfield viscosity measured at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w is at least 10000 mPas, for example in the range of 10000-30000 mPas. Whenever the catalyst TEMPO is mentioned in this disclosure, it is evident that all measures and operations where TEMPO is involved apply equally and analogously to any derivative of TEMPO or any heterocyclic nitroxyl radical capable of catalyzing selectively the oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of C6 carbon in cellulose. The modifications of nanofibrillar cellulose disclosed herein may also be applied to other fibrillar cellulose grades described herein. For example also highly refined cellulose or microfibrillar cellulose may be similarly chemically or enzymatically modified. However, there are differences for example in the final fibrillation degree of the materials. In one example such chemically modified nanofibrillar cellulose, when dispersed in water, provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 10000 mPas measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. In one example such chemically modified nanofibrillar cellulose, when dispersed in water, provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 15000 mPas measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. In one example such chemically modified nanofibrillar cellulose, when dispersed in water, provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 18000 mPas measured at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. Examples of anionic nanofibrillar celluloses used have a Brookfield viscosity in the range of 13000-15000 mPas or 18000-20000 mPas, or even up to 25000 mPas, depending on the degree of fibrillation. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose is TEMPO oxidized nanofibrillar cellulose. It provides high viscosity at low concentrations, for example a Brookfield viscosity of at least 20000 mPas, even at least 25000 mPas, measured at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. In one example the Brookfield viscosity of TEMPO oxidized nanofibrillar cellulose is in the range of 20000-30000 mPas, such as 25000-30000 mPas, measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose comprises chemically unmodified nanofibrillar cellulose. In one example such chemically unmodified nanofibrillar cellulose, when dispersed in water, provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 2000 mPas, or at least 3000 mPas, measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. The nanofibrillar cellulose may also be characterized by the average diameter or width, or by the average diameter together with the viscosity, such as Brookfield viscosity or zero shear viscosity. In one example nanofibrillar cellulose suitable for use in the products described herein has an average diameter of a fibril in the range of 1-200 nm, or 1-100 nm. In one example said nanofibrillar cellulose has an average diameter of a fibril in the range of 1-50 nm, such as 2-20 nm or 5-30 nm. In one example said nanofibrillar cellulose has an average diameter of a fibril in the range of 2-15 nm, such as in the case of TEMPO oxidized nanofibrillar cellulose. The diameter of a fibril may be determined with several techniques, such as by microscopy. Fibril thickness and width distribution may be measured by image analysis of the images from a field emission scanning electron microscope FE-SEM, a transmission electron microscope TEM, such as a cryogenic transmission electron microscope cryo-TEM, or an atomic force microscope AFM. In general AFM and TEM suit best for nanofibrillar cellulose grades with narrow fibril diameter distribution. In one example a rheometer viscosity of the nanofibrillar cellulose dispersion is measured at 22 C. with a stress controlled rotational rheometer AR-G2, TA Instruments, UK equipped with a narrow gap vane geometry diameter 28 mm, length 42 mm in a cylindrical sample cup having a diameter of 30 mm. After loading the samples to the rheometer they are allowed to rest for 5 min before the measurement is started. The steady state viscosity is measured with a gradually increasing shear stress proportional to applied torque and the shear rate proportional to angular velocity is measured. The reported viscosity =shear stress/shear rate at a certain shear stress is recorded after reaching a constant shear rate or after a maximum time of 2 min. The measurement is stopped when a shear rate of 1000 s1 is exceeded. This method may be used for determining the zero-shear viscosity. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose, when dispersed in water, provides a zero shear viscosity plateau of constant viscosity at small shearing stresses in the range of 1000-100000 Pas, such as in the range of 5000-50000 Pas, and a yield stress shear stress where the shear thinning begins in the range of 1-50 Pa, such as in the range of 3-15 Pa, determined by rotational rheometer at a consistency of 0. 5% w/w by weight in aqueous medium at 20 C. 1 C. Such nanofibrillar cellulose may also have an average diameter of a fibril of 200 nm or less, such as in the range of 1-200 nm. Turbidity is the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by individual particles total suspended or dissolved solids that are generally invisible to the naked eye. There are several practical ways of measuring turbidity, the most direct being some measure of attenuation that is, reduction in strength of light as it passes through a sample column of water. The alternatively used Jackson Candle method units: Jackson Turbidity Unit or JTU is essentially the inverse measure of the length of a column of water needed to completely obscure a candle flame viewed through it. Turbidity may be measured quantitatively using optical turbidity measuring instruments. There are several commercial turbidometers available for measuring turbidity quantitatively. In the present case the method based on nephelometry is used. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units NTU. The measuring apparatus turbidometer is calibrated and controlled with standard calibration samples, followed by measuring of the turbidity of the diluted NFC sample. In one turbidity measurement method, a nanofibrillar cellulose sample is diluted in water, to a concentration below the gel point of said nanofibrillar cellulose, and turbidity of the diluted sample is measured. Said concentration where the turbidity of the nanofibrillar cellulose samples is measured is 0. 1%. HACH P2100 Turbidometer with a 50 ml measuring vessel is used for turbidity measurements. The dry matter of the nanofibrillar cellulose sample is determined and 0. 5 g of the sample, calculated as dry matter, is loaded in the measuring vessel, which is filled with tap water to 500 g and vigorously mixed by shaking for about 30 s. Without delay the aqueous mixture is divided into 5 measuring vessels, which are inserted in the turbidometer. Three measurements on each vessel are carried out. The mean value and standard deviation are calculated from the obtained results, and the final result is given as NTU units. One way to characterize nanofibrillar cellulose is to define both the viscosity and the turbidity. Low turbidity refers to small size of the fibrils, such as small diameter, as small fibrils scatter light poorly. In general as the fibrillation degree increases, the viscosity increases and at the same time the turbidity decreases. This happens, however, until a certain point. When the fibrillation is further continued, the fibrils finally begin to break and cannot form a strong network any more. Therefore, after this point, both the turbidity and the viscosity begin to decrease. In one example the turbidity of anionic nanofibrillar cellulose is lower than 90 NTU, for example from 3 to 90 NTU, such as from 5 to 60, for example 8-40 measured at a consistency of 0. 1% w/w in aqueous medium, and measured by nephelometry. In one example the turbidity of native nanofibrillar may be even over 200 NTU, for example from 10 to 220 NTU, such as from 20 to 200, for example 50-200 measured at measured at 20 C. 1 C. a consistency of 0. 1% w/w in aqueous medium, and measured by nephelometry. To characterize the nanofibrillar cellulose these ranges may be combined with the viscosity ranges of the nanofibrillar cellulose, such as nanofibrillar cellulose which, when dispersed in water, provides a Brookfield viscosity of at least 2000 mPas, at least 3000 mPas, at least 5000 mPas, such as at least 10000 mPas, for example at least 15000 mPas measured at measured at 20 C. 1 C. , at a consistency of 0. 8% w/w and at 10 rpm. Auxiliary agents for enhancing the manufacturing process or improving or adjusting the properties of the product may be included in the nanofibrillar cellulose dispersion. Such auxiliary agents may be soluble in the liquid phase of the dispersion, they may form an emulsion or they may be solid. Auxiliary agents may be added already during the manufacturing of the nanofibrillar cellulose dispersion to the raw material or they may be added to a formed nanofibrillar cellulose dispersion or gel. The auxiliary agents may be also added to the final product, for example by impregnating, spraying, dipping, soaking or the like method. The auxiliary agents are usually not covalently bound to the nanofibrillar cellulose, so they may be releasable from the nanocellulose matrix. A controlled and/or sustained release of such agents may be obtained when using NFC as matrix. Examples of auxiliary agents include therapeutic pharmaceutic and cosmetic agents and other agents affecting to the properties of the product or to the properties of the active agents, such as buffers, surfactants, plasticizers, emulsifiers or the like. In one example the dispersion contains one or more salts, which may be added to enhance the properties of the final product or to facilitate water removal from the product in the manufacturing process. One example of the salt is sodium chloride. The salt may be included in an amount in the range of 0. 01-1. 0% w/w of the dry matter in the dispersion. The final product may also be dipped or soaked in a solution of sodium chloride, such as in an aqueous solution of about 0. 9% sodium chloride. Desired sodium chloride content in the final product may be in the range of 0. 5-1%, such as about 0. 9%, of the volume of the wet product. The salts, buffers and the like agents may be provided to obtain physiological conditions. The nanofibrillar cellulose material may be provided as hydrogel, to which the cells are to be combined. The hydrogel may be present in any of the forms described herein. HydrogelsNanofibrillar cellulose, when not completely dewatered, may have a moisture content in the range of 80-99. 9% w/w, or 50-99. 8% w/w. When the nanofibrillar cellulose is present as a gel, it may have a moisture content in the range of 90-99. 8% w/w. The gel may be called as hydrogel. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be provided in gel form, more particularly as a medical hydrogel. The gel may be mouldable and it may be applied or formed onto a target, such as to cell culture plate, multi-well plate, vial or other container, whereto it may be attached. The target may be also an individual in need of therapy by using the cells included or encapsulated in the hydrogel, such as stem cells. One example provides a method for preparing such a hydrogel, the method comprising providing pulp, disintegrating the pulp until nanofibrillar cellulose is obtained, forming the nanofibrillar cellulose into a hydrogel The nanofibrillar cellulose may be fibrillated into a desired fibrillation degree and adjusted into desired water content, or otherwise modified, so that it forms a gel having desired properties as described herein. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose in the hydrogel is anionically modified nanofibrillar cellulose. The hydrogel to be used as a medical or scientific hydrogel needs to be homogenous. Therefore the method for preparing the hydrogel may include homogenizing a hydrogel comprising nanofibrillar cellulose, preferably with a homogenizing device such as ones described herein. With this preferably non-fibrillating homogenizing step it is possible to remove areas of discontinuity from the gel. A homogenous gel having better properties for the applications is obtained. The hydrogel may be further sterilized, for example by using heat and/or radiation, and/or by adding sterilizing agents, such as antimicrobials. The nanofibrillar cellulose provided for preparing the cell system may have an initial water content in the range of 80-99. 9% w/w, or 50-99. 8% w/w, such as 90-99. 8% w/w. The material may or may not be in a gel form. More dewatered material may be provided, which facilitates storing, and such material usually needs rehydrating prior to use. Water or cell storage medium may be added. Cell SystemThe cell system may be formed by combining the cells and nanofibrillar cellulose, such as hydrogel comprising nanofibrillar cellulose. The cells may be included or encapsulated in the hydrogel, and both terms may be used interchangeably. The cells may be provided in a suspension, and combined with nanofibrillar cellulose to form a hydrogel comprising the cells. The hydrogel may be also called as cell storage material. The cell system refers to an entity containing the cells and the matrix comprising nanofibrillar cellulose in suitable form, wherein the cell system may be stored and/or transferred from a first location to a second location. The cell system may be included in a container and/or a package. For example the cell system may be applied or provided in a vial, plate, multi-well plate, test tube, bottle or other suitable container. The container may be sealed, for example covered with a sealing membrane or packed in a plastic bag, wrapping or the like. The cell system may be protected from light with the sealing or a package, especially if any light sensitive agents are used in the cell storage medium. The cell system contains liquid cell storage medium. In general the nanofibrillar cellulose contains a large amount of liquid, and it is possible to provide the matrix also as separate entities which are further suspended into the liquid medium. Different cell system materials may be prepared and provided. These materials may be used for storing, transporting and providing different types of cells in different methods. Storing the cells also enables quality control, especially when the cells are waiting for approval to release. The cell system comprises cell storage medium, which may be also called as pausing medium, which may be different from cell culture medium. The cell storage medium comprises one or more buffering agents. In one embodiment a cell storage medium comprises zwitterionic buffering agent, such as 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid HEPES which was found advantageous in the tests. The buffering agents should preferably have a pKa value in the range of 6-8. Cells can be stored and/or controlled in NFC hydrogels for long time, for example for 2-7 days or even longer up to 14 or 21 days. The cell system may be provided at hypothermic temperature, as disclosed herein. Preferably the cell system is provided at a temperature in the range of 0-30 C. , such as 0-25 C. When forming the cell system, the nanofibrillar cellulose material may be provided in a form of a hydrogel and/or a dispersion at the desired temperature and/or the cells, which may be present as a suspension, may be provided at the desired temperature. The method for preparing the cell system may comprise cooling the nanofibrillar cellulose hydrogel and/or dispersion to the desired temperature and/or cooling the cell suspension to the desired temperature. The method may also comprise cooling the formed cell system to the desired temperature. The temperature is selected in such way that the cells are not frozen, preferably at least 0 C. , 1 C. or 2 C. , such as in the range of 1-25 C. or 2-25 C. Further, too high temperatures should also be avoided, especially in the case of sensitive cells, such as stem cells, which need to be maintained at an undifferentiated state. Refrigerated temperatures, such as in the range of 1-10 C. , for example about 4 C. , may be used. However, it may be difficult to maintain such a temperature in cases where the cells are transported by mail delivery or the like. It was found out that the cells, even stem cells, remain viable at ambient temperatures, such as room temperatures even up to 25 C. In one embodiment the temperature is in the range of 10-25 C. , or 15-25 C. , such as 18-23 C. The desired temperatures can be maintained during the storage and transport by simply using isolated package, preferably containing ice, such as Styrofoam package, or by using a refrigerated box, or the like. During storage the cell system may be stored in a refrigerator or even at room temperature. The present disclosure provides a cell storage or cell delivery composition, material or matrix comprising the nanofibrillar cellulose product, such as in a form of a hydrogel, bodies or a membrane in wet state. The cell storage material may be provided at a first water content, and aqueous liquid may be added to the material to obtain a second water content. The wet state may refer to the first or the second water content. The second water content may be the water content the cell system, such as during storage or delivering the cells. The first water content may be the water content of the product or material described herein, such as water content below 20%. The second water content may be a water content of 90% or more, such as 95% or more, 98% or more, or 99% or more, which may be considered as hydrogels. The added aqueous liquid may be cell storage medium. Cell culture medium is an aqueous medium used in the cell culture. The cell storage medium is preferably different from cell culture medium. When the cells are applied to the cell storage material i. e. to the hydrogel, the cell culture medium may be exchanged to cell storage medium. The cell storage material may already contain cell storage medium, more particularly the hydrogel may be based on the cell storage medium. The cells may be washed with the cell storage medium before applied to the cell storage material. The cells may be cultured in the hydrogel, and the cell culture medium is exchanged into cell storage medium while the cells are present in the hydrogel. This may be carried our for example by soaking the hydrogel in the cell storage medium. The cell storage medium may or may not contain agents that are usually included in cell culture medium, such as serum or components thereof. The cell storage medium aims to maintain the ionic and osmotic balances, inhibit acidosis and/or prevent cell swelling at low temperatures. These features facilitate preservation of cell homeostasis, which is not achievable when using just culture medium as a preservation formulation. One example of cell storage medium is a buffer solution, especially buffer-salt-solution, for example isotonic buffer, such as phosphate buffered saline. At the simples the cell storage medium contains only one or more buffering agents and optionally one or more salts. The cell storage medium may also contain one or more osmotic/oncotic stabilizers, free radical scavengers/antioxidants, ion chelators, membrane stabilizers and/or energy substrates. The cell storage medium may or may not contain any organic molecules in addition to possible buffering agents, such as nutrients, serums or biologically active agents. The cell storage medium may be protein and/or serum free medium, such as animal or human serum free medium. A buffer solution is an aqueous solution comprising a mixture of weak acid and its conjugate base, or vice versa. Buffer solution may be used to maintain pH at substantially or nearly constant value. The pH of the cell storage medium may be in the range of 6-8, such as 7. 0-7. 7. Especially stem cells may require a pH range around 7. 4, such as 7. 2-7. 6. Examples of buffering agents useful in biological applications include TAPS [Trishydroxymethylmethylamino]propanesulfonic acid, Bicine 2-Bis2-hydroxyethylaminoacetic acid, Tris Trishydroxymethylaminomethane or, 2-Amino-2-hydroxymethylpropane-1,3-diol, Tricine 3-[N-Trishydroxymethylmethylamino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, TAPSO 3-[N-Trishydroxymethylmethylamino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid, HEPES 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, TES 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-hydroxymethylpropan-2-yl]amino]ethanesulfonic acid, MOPS 3-N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid, PIPES Piperazine-N,N-bis2-ethanesulfonic acid, Cacodylate Dimethylarsenic acid, and MES 2-N-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid. One specific example of a general buffer solution is phosphate buffered saline PBS, which usually has a pH of 7. 4. It is a water-based salt solution containing disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride and, in some formulations, potassium chloride and potassium dihydrogen phosphate. The osmolarity and ion concentrations of the solutions match those of the human body, so it is isotonic. In general the cell storage medium comprises one or more buffering agents. In one embodiment a cell storage medium comprises zwitterionic buffering agent, such as 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid HEPES which was found advantageous in the tests. The buffering agents should preferably have a pKa value in the range of 6-8. The buffering agent content in the cell storage medium may be less than 100 mM, such as 10-50 mM, or 20-30 mM, for example 20-25 mM. Other examples of zwitterionic buffering agents include 3-N-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid MOPS, 2-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bishydroxymethylethylamino]ethanesulfonic acid TES, and N-2-acetamido-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid ACES. The cell storage medium may contain one or more osmotic agents, also called as osmotic stabilizers, which are used for adjusting the osmotic pressure or osmotic concentration osmolarity of the medium, preferably to provide isotonic solution and/or to obtain a desired osmotic pressure. Examples of osmotic agents include glucose, glucose-based polymers, starch, dextran, gelatin, albumin, amino acids, such as glutamine, polypeptides, oligopeptides, dipepdides such as ultraglutamine, glycerol, or combinations thereof, such as glucose-based polymers and amino acids, or amino acids and glycerol. These agents may also act as energy substrates. The osmotic agents may be provided in a concentration in the range of 0. 5-2% w/w, such as 1-1. 5% w/w. Also ionic compounds such as salts, for example sodium chloride, may be provided as osmotic agents. The osmotic pressure of the medium may be in the range of 250-350 mOsm/kg, such as 260-320 mOsm/kg. The cell storage medium may contain one or more oncotic agents, also called as oncotic stabilizers. Oncotic pressure, or colloid osmotic pressure, is a form of osmotic pressure exerted by proteins. The cell storage medium may also contain one or more chelating agents, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA, vitamin E, ultraglutamine, sodium bicarbonate, and/or one or more protease inhibitors.

Cell storage medium is included in the cell system. The cell system may be any cell system described herein. The first and the second concentration, which may be also presented as consistencies and which refer to the concentration or consistency of the nanofibrillar cellulose, may be substantially same or different. For example if the cells are provided in a suspension, the second concentration may be lower than the first concentration. The first concentration may be for example in the range of 0. 1-20% w/w, such as 0. 1-10% w/w, 0. 1-5% w/w, or 0. 1-2. 0% w/wThe hydrogel may be provided in such first concentration that when combining the cells in a suspension or in the like aqueous formulation and the hydrogel, a desired second concentration is obtained, which may be in the range of 0. 1-10% w/w, such as 0. 2-5% w/w, 0. 4-2% w/w A concentration over 0. 7% w/w, such as in the range of 0. 8-1. 5% w/w, enhanced stem cell viability. In many cases a concentration in the range of 0. 5-1. 5% w/w is suitable. The cells may be mammalian cells, such as human or animal cells. The cells may be stem cells, such as human or animal stem cells. The stem cells may be non-embryonic stem cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells, or other stem cell lines, such as human embryonic stem cell lines, generated without embryo destruction. The cell system may contain a variety of cells, for example in a range of 0. 1-10 million cells/ml gel, such as 0. 5-5 million cells/ml or 1-10 million cells/ml, for example 1-3 million cells/ml. The gel concentration may be any concentration described herein, such as 0. 1-10%, such as 0. 2-5% w/w, 0. 4-2% w/w, or 0. 8-1. 5% w/w. The method may comprise storing the cell system at a temperature in the range of 1-25 C. , such as 1-10 C. which may be obtained in a refrigerator, or 15-25 C. , such as 13-23 C. or 18-20 C. which may be ambient temperatures. The cells may be also stored at atmospheric conditions, such as at atmospheric pressure, and at atmospheric CO2 or O2 concentrations. The method may comprise storing the cells in the cell system for at least 24 hours, or at least 56 or 72 hours, such as 24-52, 24-72 or 24-168 hours, even 1-21 days, such as 1-14 days or 1-7 days. Such storing may be classified as short-term storage, and it is suitable for example when cells need to be transported to another location, or if there is a pause in the use of the cells, such as during weekend or other non-working days. Storing may be also needed to enable quality control before transport and/or release. Aqueous cell storage medium may be provided and the cell and the nanofibrillar cellulose may be combined with the cell storage medium. In one embodiment the method comprises providing cell storage medium comprising zwitterionic buffering agent, such as 4-2-hydroxyethyl-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, and combining the cells and the nanofibrillar cellulose with the cell storage medium. The present disclosure provides a method for providing eukaryotic cells, the method comprising providing the cell system described herein, releasing the cells from the hydrogel, for example by enzymatically digesting the hydrogel or by diluting the hydrogel, to provide the cells. The method may comprise digesting the hydrogel enzymatically with one or more cellulases, preferably by using a dose of 500-1500 g enzyme/mg gel, more preferably 1000-1300 g/mg, such as for 1-4 hours, preferably 1. 5-2. 5 hours. Lower doses may also be used, for example ranging up from 300 g/mg, such as in the range of 300-1500 g/mg or 300-1000 g/mg. Using a lower dose of enzyme may however require more time, which may risk the viability of the cells.

A mixture comprising the material is obtained. The mixture may be further combined and/or mixed with one or more auxiliary agents, such as salts, pH adjusting agents and the like. One example provides a kit comprising a first and a second container, the first container comprising the nanofibrillar cellulose or the nanofibrillar cellulose in dehydrated form such as dry powder, concentrated granulate, or concentrated hydrogel body, and the second container comprising cellulase. One example provides a three-dimensional discontinuous entity for storing cells comprising an aqueous medium and hydrogel bodies comprising the nanofibrillar cellulose product suspended in the aqueous medium. The aqueous medium may be cell storage medium. In one example the hydrogel bodies are interconnected. The hydrogel bodies may have a water content in the range of 1-90%, more particularly 1-50%, or 1-20%. If the material is highly dewatered, it may have a water content in the range of 0-20%, 0-10% or 1-10%, and instead of hydrogel bodies the material may be provided as nanofibrillar cellulose bodies. The three-dimensional discontinuous entity is obtainable by a method comprising steps of providing the nanofibrillar cellulose product in a first aqueous medium to provide a hydrogel, and mixing said hydrogel with a second aqueous medium to obtain a suspension of hydrogel bodies in the second aqueous medium. The first and the second aqueous medium can be of same medium type, but they may also be different, for example the first medium being cell storage medium and the second medium being cell culture medium. The three-dimensional discontinuous entities can be made also from concentrated cellulose nanofibril hydrogels or from dry cellulose nanofibrils by granulating the concentrated hydrogel or dry cellulose nanofibrils to obtain granules, hydrating the granules in an aqueous medium, and mixing the hydrated granules, optionally adding aqueous medium, to obtain a suspension of hydrogel bodies. The discontinuous structure of the hydrogel can be verified by simple microscopic analysis or yield stress determination and comparison with the homogeneous hydrogel having the corresponding NFC concentration. Discontinuous gel structures can be made also from concentrated 10-30% w/w or even from dry cellulose nanofiber products. When using dry or concentrated materials, the sample is first granulated to an appropriate size 0. 1-2 mm, hydrated in water or in cell culture medium, and then activated into either continuous or discontinuous form using appropriate methods. Spray dried particles, having an average diameter in the range of 2-20 micrometers, can be also used as a starting material. The controlled porosity in these kinds of discontinuous gels is dependent on particle size and the total concentration, i. e. distance between the swollen gel domains or gel bodiesThe products described herein may be provided as packed in a packing containing one or more of the products. The products may be packed in sealed packings, for example to keep them uncontaminated and to maintain moisture content, such as when the products is provided as dried or at a certain water content. When a product provided as dried or dewatered is used, it may be moisturized to a desired moisture content prior to use. In one example the total volume of the hydrogel bodies from total volume of the three-dimensional discontinuous entity is in the range of 10-99% v/v, such as 50-95% v/v. The yield stress of the three-dimensional discontinuous entity is lower than the yield stress of the corresponding continuous hydrogel in the same conditions, such as 1-95% of the yield stress of the corresponding continuous hydrogel in the same conditions. One example provides a discontinuous three-dimensional entity and a method for producing such, wherein the method for manufacturing a three-dimensional discontinuous entity for storing cells comprises providing the nanofibrillar cellulose product in a form of i a homogeneous hydrogel; ii a combination of the homogeneous hydrogel with an aqueous medium; and/or iii dehydrated gel bodies or dry granulated nanofibrillar cellulose product hydrated in an aqueous medium; and mixing at conditions favouring mechanical disruption of the homogeneous structure of the hydrogel to obtain a suspension of hydrogel bodies as a three-dimensional discontinuous entity.

One example provides a cell system and a method for preparing a cell system, comprising providing the cell storage material disclosed herein, providing cells, providing an aqueous cell storage medium, and mixing them to obtain a cell system. One example provides an article and use of the article for cell storage, the article comprising a substrate having a surface; a three-dimensional discontinuous entity comprising an aqueous medium and hydrogel bodies comprising the nanofibrillar cellulose product suspended in the aqueous medium, or a three dimensional discontinuous entity comprising an aqueous medium and hydrogel bodies comprising the nanofibrillar cellulose product suspended in the aqueous medium in a dehydrated form. The articles comprising the three-dimensional discontinuous entities may be any article suitable for storing cells, such as cell culture bottles, plates and dishes, multiwell culture plates, microtiter plates, high throughput plates and the like. The fraction volume of the gel bodies comprising the three-dimensional discontinuous entity may vary between 50% and 99% of the total volume of the three-dimensional discontinuous entity and, accordingly, the local CNF concentration may be higher or lower than that of the total entity. The fraction of the gel bodies may be qualitatively determined readily by inspection under microscope or by sedimentation analysis. One example provides a kit comprising a first and a second container, the first container comprising the three-dimensional discontinuous entity or the three-dimensional discontinuous entity in dehydrated form such as dry powder, concentrated granulate, or concentrated hydrogel body, and the second container comprising cellulase. The term three-dimensional discontinuous entity refers to a system having three-dimensionally discontinuous structure. Said entity comprises an aqueous medium and hydrogel bodies comprising cellulose nanofibrils and/or derivatives thereof suspended in the aqueous medium. Discontinuous refers to the heterogeneous structure of the entity or to interruptions in the physical continuity within the entity, for example interruptions in the aqueous medium by hydrogel bodies or interruptions in and/or between hydrogel bodies by the aqueous medium. In general the discontinuous material may comprise a plurality of separate, including partly separate, bodies, domains, granules, particles and the like, which may have substantially spherical, elliptical, or the like, or uneven shape. The plurality of bodies, domains, granules, particles and the like may be also partly interconnected in the discontinuous material. Discontinuous refers to material which is not substantially homogenous. For example a block or a membrane of hydrogel is not discontinuous, but plurality of beads, spheres or the like separate bodies suspended in liquid medium form a discontinuous entity, even if some of the bodies are attached to each other. In one embodiment the nanofibrillar cellulose is in a form of separate bodies, which may be hydrogel bodies, such as beads. A hydrogel body and a hydrogel domain refer to an aliquot, a division, a domain, a fraction, a portion or a dose of a hydrogel, preferably having a continuous inner structure. The hydrogel body may have a well-defined, indefinite, symmetrical or asymmetrical shape. Suspended or suspension when used in context of three-dimensional discontinuous entity or hydrogel bodies refers to a heterogeneous mixture of an aqueous medium and hydrogel wherein the hydrogel may be present as separate and/or interconnected hydrogel bodies. Interconnected and interconnection when used in context of hydrogel bodies refers to a system where the hydrogel bodies are in contact with each other. The contact may be a direct connection between the hydrogel bodies or the hydrogel bodies may be loosely connected. When the homogeneous structure of the hydrogel is broken by mixing, the resulting discontinuous structure is characterized by hydrogel bodies of different sizes and forms. The resulting system may contain aqueous cavities between interconnected gel bodies or the loosely connected hydrogel bodies may float in the aqueous medium having contacts with each other. The hydrogel bodies may be indirectly connected via cells or other components present in the system. Dehydrated or dewatered form refers to form of the material in which some but not necessarily all water is removed from the material in question. Thus, the term dehydrated encompasses concentrated slurries, granules, flakes, and powders. The dehydrated material may have a water content in the range of 0-90% w/w, such as 0-80% w/w, 0-50% w/w, 1-50% w/w, 1-40% w/w, 1-30% w/w, 1-20% w/w, 10-50% w/w, 10-40% w/w, 10-30% w/w, or 1-10% w/w. The term kit refers to a combination of articles or containers that facilitate a method, assay, or manipulation of the three-dimensional discontinuous entity or articles for cell storage using such. Kits may contain instructions describing how to use the kit , instructions describing the methods of the invention, cartridges, mixing stations, chemical reagents, as well as other components. Kit components may be packaged together in one container box, wrapping, and the like for shipment, storage, or use, or may be packaged in two or more containers. Use of CellsThe cells included in the cell system may be transported to a site of use and provided for the use. It is possible to prepare, culture and/or provide cells at a first location, store the cells in the cell system described herein, and transport the cells in the cell system to a second location, wherein the cells may be used, studied, tested, released, administered or otherwise utilized. The present disclosure provides a method for providing eukaryotic cells, the method comprising providing the cell system described herein, and releasing the cells from the hydrogel to provide the cells. One example provides a method for transporting cells, comprising providing the cell system and transporting the cells in the cell system as disclosed herein. The cells may be released from the hydrogel by using any suitable method. In one embodiment the cells are released by enzymatically digesting the hydrogel. In one embodiment the cells are released by diluting the hydrogel. In one example the cells are released by centrifuging the hydrogel, for example though filter material. In one embodiment the cells are released by filtering the hydrogel. A combination of these method may be used, for example the hydrogel may be first enzymatically digested to weaken the gel structure, and then the gel is centrifuged and/or filtered. The hydrogel may be diluted into a concentration wherein the nanofibrillar material no longer is present as hydrogel, or the viscosity of the hydrogel has substantially lowered, so that the cells are not strongly retained in the material any more and can be easily released and recovered, for example by centrifuging and/or filtering. Cell storage medium or other suitable aqueous medium may be used for diluting the hydrogel. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be diluted to a concentration below 0. 1% w/w, below 0. 05% w/w, below 0. 03% w/w, or below 0. 01% w/w, wherein the material no longer is in a gel form, at least not in a strong gel form. The removal of cellulose nanofibers may be carried out for example with enzyme mixtures comprising one or more enzymes, such as some or all necessary enzymes for partial or total degradation of cellulose molecules as well as other wood derived components in it, such as hemicelluloses. Examples of the enzymes include exocellulases, such as exoglucanases, and endocellulases, such as endoglucanases. Further examples include designed enzyme mixtures for the NFC in question and commercially available cellulase-hemicellulase preparations. The composition of the mixture can vary depending on the chemical composition of the raw material used for production of that NFC. For example when birch pulp is used for production of NFC the mixture includes at least intact endo- and exocellulases or parts thereof, endo-xylanases and 13-D-glycosidases and 13-D-xylosidases. For hydrolysis of softwood-derived NFC the mixture needs to be supplemented at least with endomannanases and 13-D-mannosidases. The benefit of designed mixtures pooled from purified enzyme components is that they do not contain additional proteins or other unwanted components, such as side activities, debris from the cultivation organism or residues from culture broth, which is often the case for commercial enzyme preparations. Especially harmful is, if the preparation contains proteases, which might attack on the cell surfaces. Commercial enzyme mixtures designated for total hydrolysis of plant based materials can also be used in hydrolysis of NFC, but more preferably after at least crude purification step, such as gel filtration or dialysis. Regardless of the enzyme preparation, either a designed or commercial mixture, the components are selected so that they can optimally hydrolyse NFC for example in respect of pH, temperature and ionic strength. Commercial preparations are available, which are acting either in the acidic pH values pH 3. 5-5 or basic pH values pH 6-8 and at temperatures from room temperature up to 60-80 C. Very often the cells are grown at 37 C. , which is an optimal temperature for the most cellulases and hemicellulases. The cell lines may be also genetically engineered to produce the needed enzyme proteins into the storage system. One example provides a method for removing the nanofibrillar cellulose product from a cell system, the method comprising providing a cell system, such as cell storage material containing cells; diluting said cell system with aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; optionally centrifuging the cell system to sediment the cells and cell aggregates; removing nanofibrillar cellulose product, for example by decantation. One example provides a method for removing the nanofibrillar cellulose product from a cell system, the method comprising providing a cell system, contacting the cell system with an enzyme capable of degrading the nanofibrillar cellulose material; optionally centrifuging the cell system to sediment the cells and cell aggregates; removing nanofibrillar cellulose product, for example by decantation. Preferably nanofibrillar cellulose product to be removed is enzymatically degraded to obtain at least partly and preferably mostly degraded nanofibrillar cellulose product. The cells release from the cell system may be recovered and used. The use of the cells may be medical use, for example the cells may be used in a therapeutic method comprising administering the cells to a patient in need of therapy. The use may be also scientific, research or test use. The cells may be for example applied to a test system and/or to a cell culture. Different uses may require a different medium. For example serum free medium, such as fetal bovine serum FBS free medium, may be used for cell for therapeutic applications. Especially stem cells may be used in therapeutic methods, such as in cell-based therapy. The therapeutic method may comprise stem cell transplantation. The cells may be provided to release agents, such as paracrine factors that may promote wound healing and tissue regeneration, or the cells may be provided to differentiate into desired cells at a target. During storing the cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state, and when release and applied to a target, which may be in a patient, the cells begin and/or are arranged to differentiate. Further agents may be provided to initiate this process. The present application provides medical products including the cells, which may be applied onto the skin or other tissue of a target or a subject, such as a patient or a person, human or animal, suffering from a condition. The medical products may be provided as gels, patches, plasters, bandages or the like, which may be applied onto a wound or onto damaged area or onto an area or a target requiring treatment. Such products may also include other materials, such as one or more gauzes or the like reinforcing material. The medical products may contain only one layer of nanofibrillar cellulose, or they may contain one or more additional layers, which may be nanofibrillar cellulosic layers and/or other layers. The nanofibrillar cellulose may be incorporated in a gauze, such as nonwoven. In one embodiment the medical product comprises a gauze, such as nonwoven. The gauze may be included or incorporated in the product in any suitable manner described herein. The moisture content of the combination may be in the same range as discussed in previous. In one example the nanofibrillar cellulose in a layer may have a moisture content in the range of 80-99. 9% w/w, or 50-99. 8% w/w, such as in the range of 90-99. 8% w/w, especially when incorporated with a gauze. The therapeutic methods wherein the stem cells may be used, are various and include for example tissue regeneration, cardiovascular disease treatment, brain disease treatment, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease treatment, cell deficiency therapy, such as in type I diabetes, blood disease treatments, such as providing hematopoietic stem cells for treating leukemia, sick cell anemia and other immunodeficiency problems.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "The disclosure is related generally to solar cell panels and, more specifically, to solar cells for a solar cell array.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Typical spaceflight-capable solar cell panel assembly involves building long strings of solar cells. These strings are variable in length and can be very long, for example, up to and greater than 20 cells. Assembling such long, variable, and fragile materials is difficult, which has prevented automation of the assembly. Existing solutions use solar cells assembled into CIC cell, interconnect and coverglass units. The CIC has metal foil interconnects connected to the front of the cell that extend in parallel from one side of the CIC. The CICs are located close to each other and the interconnects make connection to the bottom of an adjacent cell. Using these interconnects, the CICs are assembled into linear strings. These linear strings are built-up manually and then laid out to form a large solar cell array comprised of many strings of variable length. Additionally, a bypass diode is used to protect the cells from reverse bias, when the cells become partially shadowed. The bypass diode generally connects the back contacts of two adjacent cells within the solar cell array. When used in a satellite, the solar cell array is typically packaged as a panel. The dimensions of the panel are dictated by the needs of the satellite, including such constraints as needed power, as well as the size and shape necessary to pack and store the satellite in a launch vehicle. Furthermore, the deployment of the panel often requires that some portions of the panel are used for the mechanical fixtures and the solar cell array must avoid these locations. In practice, the panel is generally rectangular, but its dimensions and aspect ratio vary greatly. The layout of the CICs and strings to fill this space must be highly customized for maximum power generation, which results in a fabrication process that is highly manual. What is needed, then, is a means for promoting automated manufacturing of solar arrays, while preserving the ability for customization of solar cell arrays.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific example in which the disclosure may be practiced. It is to be understood that other examples may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. A new approach to the design of solar cell arrays, such as those used for spaceflight power applications, is based on electrical connections among the solar cells in the array. This new approach rearranges the components of a solar cell and the arrangements of the solar cells in the array. Instead of having solar cells connected into long linear strings and then assembled onto a substrate, the solar cells are attached individually to a substrate, such that corner regions of adjacent cells are aligned on the substrate, thereby exposing an area of the substrate. Electrical connections between cells are made by corner conductors formed on or in the substrate in these corner regions. Consequently, this approach presents a solar cell array design based on individual cells. Thus, a single laydown process and layout can be used in the fabrication of solar cell arrays. Current flow between solar cells will be assisted with conductors embedded in the substrate. These electrical connections define the specific characteristics of the solar cell array, such as its dimensions, stayout zones, and circuit terminations. This approach simplifies manufacturing, enables automation, and bottoms costs and delivery times. 1 and 2 illustrate conventional structures for solar cell panels 10, which include a substrate 12, a plurality of solar cells 14 arranged in an array, and electrical connectors 16 between the solar cells 14. Half size solar cells 14 are shown in 1 and full size solar cells 14 are shown in 2. Space solar cells 14 are derived from a round Germanium Ge substrate starting material, which is later fabricated into semi-rectangular shapes to improve dense packing onto the solar cell panel 10. This wafer is often diced into one or two solar cells 14 herein described as half size or full size solar cells 14. The electrical connectors 16 providing electrical connections between solar cells 14 are made along the long parallel edge between solar cells 14. These series connections cell-to-cell are completed off-substrate, as strings of connected solar cells 14 are built having lengths of any number of solar cells 14. The completed strings of solar cells 14 are then applied and attached to the substrate 12. In 2, wiring 18 is attached at the end of a string of solar cells 14 to electrically connect the string to other strings, or to terminate the resulting circuit and bring the current off of the array of solar cells 14. String-to-string and circuit termination connections are typically done on the substrate 12, and typically using wiring 18. However, some small solar cell panels 10 use a printed circuit board PCB-type material with embedded conductors. Adjacent strings of connected solar cells 14 can run parallel or anti-parallel. In addition, strings of connected solar cells 14 can be aligned or misaligned. There are many competing influences to the solar cell 14 layout resulting in regions where solar cells 14 are parallel or anti-parallel, aligned or misaligned. 3A-3B illustrate improved devices and structures for a solar cell panel 10a, according to one example, wherein 3B is an enlarged view of the details in the dashed circle in 3A. The various components of the solar cell panel 10a are shown and described in greater detail in 5-14. The solar cell panel 10a includes a substrate 12 for solar cells 14 having one or more corner conductors 20 thereon. In one example, the substrate 12 is a multi-layer substrate 12 comprised of one or more Kapton polyimide layers separating one or more patterned metal layers. The substrate 12 may be mounted on a large rigid panel 10a similar to conventional assembles. Alternatively, substrate 12 can be mounted to a lighter more sparse frame or panel 10a for mounting or deployment. A plurality of solar cells 14 are attached to the substrate 12 in a two-dimensional 2D grid of an array 22. In this example, the array 22 is comprised of ninety-six 96 solar cells 14 arranged in four 4 rows by twenty-four 24 columns, but it is recognized that any number of solar cells 14 may be used in different implementations. Alternatively, the array 22 could be comprised of forty-eight 48 full-size solar cells 14 arranged in four 4 rows by twelve 12 columns, wherein each of the full-size solar cells 14 is configured in a manner similar to two half-size solar cells 14 arranged back-to-back see, , 16-24 below. At least one of the solar cells 14 has at least one cropped corner 24 that defines a corner region 26, as indicated by the dashed circle. The solar cells 14 are attached to the substrate 12, such that corner regions 26 of adjacent ones of the solar cells 14 are aligned, thereby exposing an area 28 of the substrate 12. The area 28 of the substrate 12 that is exposed includes one or more of the corner conductors 20, and one or more electrical connections between the solar cells 14 and the corner conductors 20 are made in the corner regions 26 resulting from the cropped corners 24 of the solar cells 14. The corner conductors 20 are conductive paths attached to, printed on, buried in, or deposited on the substrate 12, before and/or after the solar cells 14 are attached to the substrate 12, which facilitate connections between adjacent solar cells 14. The connections between the solar cells 14 and the corner conductors 20 are made after the solar cells 14 have been attached to the substrate 12. In one example, four adjacent solar cells 14 are aligned on the substrate 12, such that four cropped corners 24, one from each solar cell 14, are brought together at the corner regions 26. The solar cells 14 are then individually attached to the substrate 12, wherein the solar cells 14 are placed on top of the corner conductors 20 to make the electrical connection between the solar cells 14 and the corner conductors 20. The solar cells 14 may be applied to the substrate 12 as CIC cell, interconnect and coverglass units. Alternatively, a bare solar cell 14 may be applied to the substrate 12, and the coverglass later applied to the front of the solar cell 14 with a transparent adhesive. This assembly protects the solar cells 14 from damage from space radiation that would limit performance. 4A and 4B illustrate an alternative structure for the solar cell panel 10a, according to one example, wherein 4B is an enlarged view of the details in the dashed circle in 4A. In this example, only a few corner conductors 20 are printed on or integrated with the substrate 12. Instead, most of the corner conductors 20 are contained within a power routing module PRM 30 that is bonded to the substrate 12. 5 illustrates the front side of an exemplary solar cell 14 that may be used in the improved solar cell panel 10a of 3A-3B and 4A-4B. The solar cell 14, which is a CIC unit, is a half-size solar cell 14. Full-size solar cells 14 could also be used. The solar cell 14 is fabricated having at least one cropped corner 24 that defines a corner region 26, as indicated by the dashed circle, such that the corner region 26 resulting from the cropped corner 24 includes at least one contact 32, 34 for making an electrical connection to the solar cell 14. In the example of 5, the solar cell 14 has two cropped corners 24, each of which has both a front contact 32 on the front side of the solar cell 14 and a back contact 34 on a back side of the solar cell 14, where the contacts 32 and 34 extend into the corner region 26. Full-size solar cells 14 would have four cropped corners 24, each of which would have a front contact 32 and a back contact 34. The cropped corners 24 increase utilization of the round wafer starting materials for the solar cells 14. In conventional panels 10, these cropped corners 24 would result in unused space on the panel 10 after the solar cells 14 are attached to the substrate 12. The new approach described in this disclosure, however, utilizes this unused space. Specifically, metal foil interconnects, comprising the corner conductors 20, front contacts 32 and back contacts 34, are moved to the corner regions 26. In contrast, existing CICs have interconnects attached to the solar cell 14 front side, and connect to the back side where connections occur during stringing. The current generated by the solar cell 14 is collected on the front side of the solar cell 14 by one or more grids 36 comprised of thin metal fingers 38 and wide bus bars 40 that are connected to both of the front contacts 32. There is a balance between the addition of metal in the grid 36, which reduces the light entering the solar cell 14 and its output power, and the reduced resistance of having more metal. The bus bar 40 is a low resistance conductor that carries high currents and also provides redundancy should a front contact 32 become disconnected. Optimization generally desires a short bus bar 40 running directly between the front contacts 32. Having the front contact 32 in the cropped corner 24 results in moving the bus bar 40 away from the perimeter of the solar cell 14. This is achieved while simultaneously minimizing the bus bar 40 length and light obscuration. Additionally, the fingers 38 are now shorter. This reduces parasitic resistances in the grid 36, because the length of the fingers 38 is shorter and the total current carried is less. This produces a design preference where the front contacts 32 and connecting bus bar 40 is moved to provide shorter narrow fingers 38. 6 illustrates the back side of the exemplary solar cell 14 of 5. The back side of the solar cell 14 is covered by a full area metal back layer 42 that is connected to both of the back contacts 34. 7 illustrates solar cells 14 arranged into the 2D grid of the array 22, according to one example. The array 22 comprises a plurality of solar cells 14 attached to a substrate 12, such that corner regions 26 of adjacent ones of the solar cells 14 are aligned, thereby exposing an area 28 of the substrate 12. Electrical connections not shown between the solar cells 14 are made in the exposed area 28 of the substrate 12 using the front contacts 32 and back contacts 34 of the solar cells 14 and corner conductors 20 not shown formed on or in the exposed area 28 of the substrate 12. During assembly, the solar cells 14 are individually attached to the substrate 12. This assembly can be done directly on a support surface, i. e. , the substrate 12, which can be either rigid or flexible. Alternatively, the solar cells 14 could be assembled into the 2D grid of the array 22 on a temporary support surface and then transferred to a final support surface, i. e. , the substrate 12. 8 illustrates an example of the array 22 where one or more bypass diodes 44 are added to the exposed area 28 of the substrate 12 in the corner regions 26, for use in one or more of the electrical connections. The bypass diodes 44 protect the solar cells 14 when the solar cells 14 become unable to generate current, which could be due to being partially shadowed, which drives the solar cells 14 into reverse bias. In one example, the bypass diodes 44 are attached to the substrate 12 in the corner regions 26 independent of the solar cells 14. 9 illustrates an example where the bypass diode 44 is applied to the back side of the solar cell 14, with an interconnect or contact 46 for the bypass diode 44 extending into the corner region 26 between the front and back contacts 32, 34. 10 illustrates a front side view of the example of 9, with the interconnect or contact 46 for the bypass diode 44 not shown extending into the corner region 26 between the front and back contacts 32, 34. 11 illustrates the solar cells 14 of 9 and 10 arranged into the 2D grid of the array 22 and applied to the substrate 12, where the bypass diodes 44 not shown are applied to the back side of the solar cells 14, with the contacts 46 for the bypass diodes 44 extending into the corner regions 26 of the solar cells 14. One advantage of this approach is that the layouts illustrated in 7, 8 and 11 are generalized layouts. Specifically, these layouts can be repeated across any panel 10a dimensions desired by a customer. This greatly simplifies assembly, rework, test, and inspection processes. Following solar cell 14 and bypass diode 44 placement, there is another step where customization is accomplished. The front contacts 32 and back contacts 34 in the corner regions 26 of the solar cells 14 must be connected. This can be done in many combinations in order to route current through a desired path. After attaching solar cells 14 to the substrate 12, connections are made between the solar cells 14 and the corner conductors 20. Front and back contacts 32, 34 of the solar cells 14 are present in each corner region 26 for attachment to the corner conductors 20. Interconnects for the front and back contacts 32, 34 of each of the solar cells 14 are welded, soldered, or otherwise bonded onto the corner conductors 20 to provide a conductive path 20, 32, 34 for routing current out of the solar cells 14. Using the corner conductors 20, any customization can be made in the electrical connections. Adjacent solar cells 14 can be electrically connected to flow current in up/down or left/right directions as desired by the specific design. Current flow can also be routed around stayout zones as needed. The length or width of the solar cell array 22 can be set as desired. Also, the width can vary over the length of the array 22. In one example, the electrical connections are series connections that determine a flow of current through the plurality of solar cells 14. This may be accomplished by the connection schemes shown in 12 and 13, wherein 12 shows up/down series connections 48 between the solar cells 14 of the array 22, and 13 shows left/right series connections 50 between the solar cells 14 of the array 22. In both 12 and 13, these series connections 48, 50 are electrical connections between the front contacts 32 and back contacts 34 of the solar cells 14, and the bypass diodes 44, are made using the corner conductors 20 formed on or in the exposed areas 28 of the substrate 12. These series connections 48, 50 determine the current power flow, as indicated by the arrows 52, through the solar cells 14, in contrast to the assembly of large strings off-substrate. The corner conductors 20 between solar cells 14 can be in many forms. They could be accomplished using wires that have electrical connections made on both ends, which could be from soldering, welding, conducting adhesive, or other process. In addition to wires, metal foil connectors, similar to the interconnects, could be applied. Metal conductive paths or traces not shown can also be integrated with the substrate 12, as in a flex sheet assembly or PCB. 14 shows a side view of an example wherein the substrate 12 is a flex sheet assembly including multilayer conductors. The substrate 12 includes a polyimide base layer 54 with Cu layer 56a above and Cu layer 56b below, wherein Cu layers 56a, 56b may be patterned as the corner conductors 20, other conductors, power lines, common lines, bridging lines, etc. Note that there may be one or multiple Cu layers 56a, 56b with polyimide layers 54 positioned between each of the layers 56a, 56b. A conducting back sheet of polyimide 58 can be applied to the polyimide layer 54, which is useful in a space environment in that it will reduce the accumulation of charge. Another capability is the addition of a plated Silver Ag or Gold Au layer 60 on the Cu layer 56a as part of the corner conductors 20, which improves the ability to make connections. Shown on the right side is the solar cell 14 that is attached to the substrate 12 with adhesive 62. Also visible is the metal foil interconnect 64 attached to the solar cell 14 and the plated Ag or Au layer 60 of the corner conductors 20. The substrate 12 also includes one or more insulating layers that separate and/or encapsulate the multilayer conductors. In one example, there are a top polyimide overlay layer 66a and bottom polyimide overlay layer 66b, wherein the top polyimide overlay layer 66a has holes drilled through it, and the holes are Cu-plated vias 68 that electrically connect Cu layer 56a with Cu layer 56b. By encasing the metal of the Cu layers 56a, 56b, the top and bottom polyimide overlay layers 66a, 66b provide valuable protection against ESD. Electrical access is provided to the buried Cu layer 56b. This could be accomplished with the via 68 connection between Cu layer 56a and Cu layer 56b, or by having an interconnect directly connect to the lower Cu layer 56b. Also, there may be multiple connections between Cu layer 56a and Cu layer 56b. This redundancy is an important attribute and can be employed when possible. In summary, this new approach attaches the solar cells 14 individually to a substrate 12 such that the corner regions 26 of two, three or four adjacent solar cells 14 are aligned on the substrate 12. The solar cells 14 are laid out so that the cropped corners 24 are aligned and the corner regions 26 are adjacent, thereby exposing an area 28 of the substrate 12. Electrical connections between solar cells 14 are made in these corner regions 26 between front contacts 32 and back contacts 34 on the solar cells 14, bypass diodes 44, and corner conductors 20 on or in the exposed area 28 of the substrate 12, wherein these conductive paths are used to create a string of solar cells 14 in a series connection 48, 50 comprising a circuit. The result is that more electrical connections are available in more corners, which simplifies the corner connections and provides redundancy. Increasing the size of solar cells 14 is facilitated by this new approach, for example, using full-size solar cells 14, because full-size solar cells 14 produce more power for a fixed amount of parts to assembly or labor cost. However, full-size solar cells 14 typically have one or more grids 36 with thin metal fingers 38 that cause high resistances, which result in power loss. One alternative is to have low resistance fingers 38 that are very wide, but wide fingers 38 block light from entering the solar cell 14 and also reduce power production. Another alternative is to use vias and backside connections. This disclosure illustrates improved structures using full-size solar cells 14, which extract current from multiple locations around the perimeter of the solar cell 14. This process eliminates the resistance penalty of larger solar cells 14. Furthermore, this disclosure describes a configuration of conductors that is highly manufacturable as well. 15A-15D illustrate how solar cells 14 are made from round wafers 70, according to one example. Various solar cell 14 shapes are diced out of the wafer 70 in order to fill a panel 10a. 15A illustrates a 150 mm diameter wafer 70 that is blank. 15B shows a wafer 70 with a pair of rectangular half-size solar cells 14, where there is a large area around the perimeters of the solar cells 14 that will be discarded. This discarded area is highly valuable, and it is desirable to maximize the utilization of the wafer material. 15C shows a wafer 70 with a pair of half-size solar cells 14 having cropped corners 24, wherein the cropped corners 24 improve utilization of the wafer 70 area. Specifically, there is a smaller area around the perimeters of the solar cells 14 that will be discarded, as compared to 15B. 15D shows a wafer 70 with a single full-size solar cell 14 having cropped corners 24. Like the half-size solar cells 14 of 15C, the cropped corners 24 of the single full-size solar cell 14 improve utilization of the wafer 70 area. Specifically, there is a smaller area around the perimeters of the solar cells 14 that will be discarded, as compared to 15B, wherein the area is roughly equivalent to the area around the perimeters of the solar cells 14 that will be discarded in 15C. 16 shows a structure where nine 9 full-size solar cells 14 are assembled together in a solar cell array 22 comprised of three 3 rows by three 3 columns. Multiple grids 36 are shown in the face of the center solar cell 14, wherein each of the grids 36 terminate at one or more of the front contacts 32 of the solar cell 14. Similar grids 36 would be present on the other solar cells 14 in the array 22, but are omitted to simplify the figure. By extracting current at multiple points around the perimeter of the solar cell 14, the length of the fingers 38 in each of the grids 36 can be minimized, as compared to a conventional structure for extracting current from a single side of the solar cell 14. These four terminations minimize the distance the current needs to flow, which reduces the impact of resistance. Also, each termination carries one-fourth of the solar cell's current, thereby reducing energy loss, which is determined by the current squared. 17 illustrates the use of buried conductors, according to one example. The solar cells 14 are omitted from this view, with their positions 72 when mounted on the substrate 12 indicated by dashed outlines. The substrate 12 includes conductors 74a, 74b under or alongside each of the cell positions 72. The conductors 74a, 74b are buried conductors patterned in one or more of the Cu layers 56a, 56b of the substrate 12. An insulation layer is placed between these conductors 74a, 74b and the solar cells 14. In one example, the conductors 74a, 74b are both patterned in the same Cu layer 56a, 56b. The conductors 74a, 74b can also be patterned in different Cu layers 56a, 56b. In one example, the conductors 74a, 74b are loops. However, different shapes may be used, as described in 22, 23, and 24 below. In one example, the conductor 74a connects to the front contacts 32 of the solar cell 14 and the conductor 74b connects to the back contacts 34 of the solar cell 14 which are shown without the solar cell 14 present. This configuration may be reversed, with the conducting loop of the back contact 34 being inside the conducting loop of the front contact 32In one example, the conductors 74a, 74b are completely covered by the top polyimide overlay layer 66a, and are connected to the front contacts 32 and back contacts 34 of the solar cell 14 using the vias 68 between layers in the substrate 12. Portions of the conductors 74a, 74b can be exposed through the top polyimide overlay layer 66a, and are connected to the front contacts 32 and back contacts 34 of the solar cell 14 by interconnects. The conductor 74a can connect to one or more of the four front contacts 32 on the solar cell 14 and the conductor 74b can connect to one or more of the four back contacts 34 on the solar cell 14. This provides redundancy, in case there is a failure of an interconnect or conducting trace. Because they are buried in the substrate 12, the conductors 74a, 74b do not block any light from entering the solar cells 14. In addition, due to their shape, the conductors 74a, 74b carry current to all sides and corners of the solar cell 14. Preferably, the conductors 74a, 74b are comprised of sufficient metal to be low resistance paths. 18 illustrates one example of series connections between conductors 74a, 74b for adjacent solar cell positions 72 of the substrate 12. Again, the solar cells 14 are omitted from this view, with their positions 72 on the substrate 12 indicated by dashed outlines. Only the connections adjacent to the center solar cell 14 are fully drawn. The arrows 52 show the overall direction of current power between the cell positions 72. The solar cell's 14 current flows from the front of the solar cell 14 to the backside of the solar cell 14, and then continues to the next solar cell 14 in the string. In this example, the series connections are made in the corner regions 26 surrounding the center cell position 72, and include corner conductors 20 and bypass diodes 44. The series connections and bypass diodes 44 are similar to the example in 12, wherein each full size solar cell 14 has a series connection and a bypass diode 44 on both sides leading to the next solar cell 14 in series. 19 illustrates another example of series connections between conductors 74a, 74b for adjacent solar cell positions 72 of the substrate 12. Again, the solar cells 14 are omitted from this view, with their positions 72 on the substrate 12 indicated by dashed outlines. Only the connections adjacent to the center solar cell 14 are fully drawn. The arrows 52 show the overall direction of current power between the cell positions 72. In this example, the series connections are again made in the corner regions 26 surrounding the center cell position 72, and include corner conductors 20 and bypass diodes 44. However, in this example, each cell position 72 in the first and second columns has only one series connection that includes the corner conductors 20 and one bypass diode 44, leaving the third column open. Moreover, there are fewer corner conductors 20 in the series connections, which can result in less space used on the substrate 12 and higher output, or more widely spaced conductors with a greater resistance to electrostatic discharge ESD that operate at higher voltage levels. 20 illustrates another example of series connections between conductors 74a, 74b for adjacent cell positions 72 of the substrate 12. Again, the solar cells 14 are omitted from this view, with their positions 72 on the substrate 12 indicated by dashed outlines. Only the connections adjacent to the center solar cell 14 are fully drawn. The arrows 52 show the overall direction of current power between the cell positions 72. In this example, the series connections are made only in a subset of the corner regions 26 surrounding the center cell position 72, and include corner conductors 20 and bypass diodes 44. However, in this example, the series connections and bypass diodes 44 are only made on one side of the solar cells 14. The series connections and bypass diodes 44 for the first and second columns of solar cells 14 are made in the space between these solar cells 14. Between the second and third rows of solar cells 14, there are no series connections or bypass diodes 44. 21 illustrates another example of series connections between conductors 74a, 74b for adjacent cell positions 72 of the substrate 12. Again, the solar cells 14 are omitted from this view, with their positions 72 on the substrate 12 indicated by dashed outlines. The arrows 52 show the overall direction of current power between the cell positions 72. In this example, the series connections are again made in the corner regions 26 surrounding the center cell position 72, and include corner conductors 20 and bypass diodes 44. Only the connections adjacent to the center solar cell 14 are fully drawn. In this example, the series connections are made on both sides of the solar cell 14 adjacent to the next solar cell 14 in series. The bypass diode 44 is only located on one side. Many variations of these series connections, and other connections, are possible that balance trades of redundancy of conducting paths and connections versus complexity, needed diodes, and spacing between conductors. 22 illustrates a variation in the configuration of buried conductors in the substrate 12. In this example, each of the conductors 76a, 76b is U-shaped, with two substantially linear portions connected by an arcuate portion, where the linear portions are substantially parallel to each other. Each of the conductors 76a, 76b connect to all four cropped corners 24 around the perimeter of the cell position 72. 23 also illustrates a variation in the configuration of buried conductors in the substrate 12. In this example, the conductors 78a, 78b have only up or down pathways that connect the cropped corners 24 of the cell position 72 in the up/down direction of the current flow 52. This allows the conductors 78a, 78b to pass inside or outside of each other, without crossing. Moreover, the conductors 78a, 78b can be patterned in a single Cu layer 56a or Cu layer 56b without need for vias 68, which simplifies fabrication of the circuit. However, this configuration does require series connection on both sides of the cell position 72. Moreover, the back layer 42 of the solar cell 14 enables a single bypass diode 44 to be used. 24 illustrates another variation in the buried conductors in the substrate 12. The back contact 34 does not connect to a buried conductor. Instead, the back layer 42 of the solar cell 14 is used to carry current to the back contacts 34 of the solar cell 14, which eliminates the need for a buried conductor. The back contacts 34 carry current to the series-connected adjacent cell positions 72 via corner conductors 20. There is also a bypass diode 44 in these series connections. In addition, there is a single buried conductor 80 connected to the front contacts 32 and their respective grids 36. Specifically, the conductor 80 connects between two front contacts 32 parallel to the direction of current flow 52, which in this example is up/down and not left/right. Examples of the disclosure may be described in the context of a method 82 of fabricating a solar cell 14, solar cell panel 10a and/or satellite, comprising steps 84-96, as shown in 25, wherein the resulting satellite 98 having a solar cell panel 10a comprised of solar cells 14 are shown in 26. As illustrated in 25, during pre-production, exemplary method 82 may include specification and design 84 of the solar cell 14, solar cell panel 10a and/or satellite 98, and material procurement 86 for same. During production, component and subassembly manufacturing 88 and system integration 90 of the solar cell 14, solar cell panel 10a and/or satellite 98 takes place, which include fabricating the solar cell 14, solar cell panel 10a and/or satellite 98. Thereafter, the solar cell 14, solar cell panel 10a and/or satellite 98 may go through certification and delivery 92 in order to be placed in service 94. The solar cell 14, solar cell panel 10a and/or satellite 98 may also be scheduled for maintenance and service 96 which includes modification, reconfiguration, refurbishment, and so on, before being launched. Each of the processes of method 82 may be performed or carried out by a system integrator, a third party, and/or an operator , a customer. For the purposes of this description, a system integrator may include without limitation any number of solar cell, solar cell panel, satellite or spacecraft manufacturers and major-system subcontractors; a third party may include without limitation any number of venders, subcontractors, and suppliers; and an operator may be a satellite company, military entity, service organization, and so on. As shown in 26, a satellite 98 fabricated by exemplary method 82 may include systems 100, a body 102, solar cell panels 10a comprised of solar cells 14, and one or more antennae 104. Examples of the systems 100 included with the satellite 98 include, but are not limited to, one or more of a propulsion system 106, an electrical system 108, a communications system 110, and a power system 112. Any number of other systems 100 also may be included. 27 is an illustration of the solar cell panel 10a in the form of a functional block diagram, according to one example. The solar cell panel 10a is comprised of the solar cell array 22, which is comprised of one or more of the solar cells 14 individually attached to the substrate 12. Each of the solar cells 14 absorbs light 114 from a light source 116 and generates an electrical output 118 in response thereto. At least one of the solar cells 14 has at least one cropped corner 24 that defines a corner region 26, such that an area 28 of the substrate 12 remains exposed when the solar cell 14 is attached to the substrate 12. When a plurality of solar cells 14 are attached to the substrate 12, the corner regions 26 of adjacent ones of the solar cells 14 are aligned, thereby exposing the area 28 of the substrate 12. The area 28 of the substrate 12 that remains exposed includes one or more corner conductors 20 attached to, printed on, or integrated with the substrate 12, and one or more electrical connections between the solar cells 14 and the corner conductors 20 are made in a corner region 26. The corner region 26 may also include one or more bypass diodes 44. The corner region 26 includes at least one contact, for example, a front contact 32 on a front side of the solar cell 14 and/or a back contact 34 on a back side of the solar cell 14. The substrate 12 may include buried conductors 74a, 74b, 76a, 76b, 78a, 78b, 80, wherein the buried conductors 74a, 74b, 76a, 76b, 78a, 78b, 80 provide conductive paths for the front and back contacts 32, 34 of the solar cell 14. The buried conductors 74a, 74b, 76a, 76b, 78a, 78b, 80 also facilitate connections between solar cells 14. The examples discussed present series connections between the solar cells 14. With slight modification, these can terminate strings as discussed in the cross-referenced patent applications identified above. The description of the examples set forth above has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the examples described. Many alternatives, modifications and variations may be used in place of the specific elements described above.",

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "One or more embodiments of the present invention relate to a cell culture container, a support jig for a cell culture container, and a cell culture method to efficiently culture various cells.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "In recent years, efficient culture and differentiation-induction of a large amount of cells comprising tissues, microorganisms, viruses, and the like in an artificial environment have been requested in the production of medicine or in fields such as gene therapy, regenerative medicine, and immunotherapy. In such cell culture, it is necessary to maintain cell density in a culture medium within a proper range. That is, if cell density in a culture medium increases along with the proliferation of cells, growth of cells is blocked by the depletion of culture medium components necessary for proliferation, the accumulation of metabolic products of the cells themselves, and the like, leading to deterioration in the proliferation efficiency of cells. Moreover, if cell density in a culture medium is too low, it is also impossible to efficiently culture cells and induce the differentiation thereof. Thus, when cells are cultured on a certain scale, culture is generally conducted with repeated passage so that proper cell density in a culture medium is maintained. Heretofore, for subculture, a well plate, a flask, or the like has been often used as a culture container. For example, it is known to culture a large amount of cells as follows. Cells are added to individual wells together with a culture medium so as to achieve proper cell density, culture is thus started by use of a well plate, and cells are sufficiently proliferated in the wells and then transferred to a flask, a culture medium is added depending on the proliferation of cells, and culture is continued. At the point where cells have proliferated to a certain amount, passage is repeated by transferring cells to a flask having a larger capacity and further adding a culture medium , see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 2011-241159 PATENT LITERATURE 1, paragraph [0027], and the like. It is to be noted that, as a flask type culture container, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication 2006-55069 PATENT LITERATURE 2 suggests a flask type culture container having a plurality of concave portions provided on one surface of the container formed into the shape of a polyhedron such as a rectangular parallelepiped. In PATENT LITERATURE 2, an aggregate resulting from the unification of single cells is formed in a plurality of concave portions provided on a first culture surface and serving as first culture parts. This aggregate is transferred to a second culture part formed in a second culture surface in the container and having an area larger than the first culture part so that the aggregate becomes a larger aggregate. However, in conducting subculture as above, it is necessary to repeat pipetting operations many times when cells are added to individual wells of a well plate or when cells are transferred to a flask from a well plate. Moreover, cells have to be transferred to a new culture container such as a flask at every passage, which forces troublesome work, and increases the risk of contamination by bacteria, viruses, and the like. Furthermore, in the flask type culture container as in PATENT LITERATURE 2, gas is exchanged only when a cover closing an opening is removed and the opening is thus opened. Therefore, a sufficient amount of oxygen can not be supplied to cells being cultured, and the risk of contamination is unavoidable at the time of gas exchange as well. In addition, the flask type culture container having a limited capacity is unsuited to a culture of a large amount of cells on a certain scale beyond a laboratorial level.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "Hereinafter, one or more embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. A cell culture container 1 shown in 1A to 1C comprises a container main body 2 comprising a gas-permeable plastic film; and an injection/discharge port 3 comprising a tubular member through which a culture medium and cells can circulate. The container main body 2 is sealed at a peripheral portion thereof, has a bulging shape in which a top surface 2a thereof is bulged like a plateau, and is formed so that a rim of the top surface 2a formed into a flat surface is inclined and connected to at the peripheral portion. In addition, a plurality of concave portions 4 serving as cell culture parts are provided on a bottom surface 2b of the container main body 2. In order to inhibit the movement of cells in the container main body 2 so that cells being cultured remain in one concave portion 4, the concave portion 4 provided on the bottom surface 2b of the container main body 2 may have an opening diameter diameter D of 0. 3 to 10 mm, 0. 3 to 5 mm, 0. 5 to 4 mm, or 0. 5 to 2 mm, and a depth d of 0. 1 mm or more. All of the concave portions 4 may have the same opening diameter. The concave portions 4 provided on the bottom surface 2b may comprise two or more kinds of concave portions different in opening diameter by dividing the bottom surface 2b into a plurality of regions so that the opening diameter of the concave portion 4 is different in each region, for example. For example, in the present embodiment, the top surface 2a side of the container main body 2 is formed to be bulged like a plateau so that the rim of the top surface 2a is inclined and connected to the peripheral portion. Accordingly, the height of the peripheral portion side becomes lower. Therefore, when cells to be cultured are injected into the container main body 2 together with a culture medium, the amount of a culture medium comprising cells is smaller on the peripheral portion side, and the number of cells precipitating in the culture medium is also smaller. Thus, if all of the concave portions 4 have the same opening diameter, the number of cells precipitating into the concave portions 4 on the peripheral portion side becomes smaller. Therefore, it may be possible that the opening diameters of the concave portions 4 are larger on the peripheral portion side so that about the same number of cells precipitate into all of the concave portions 4. Moreover, in the cell culture container 1 shown in 1A to 1C, the shape of the concave portion 4 is a spherical crown shape so that cells are easily collected to the bottom of the concave portion 4. However, the shape of the concave portion 4 is not limited thereto. For cells to be easily collected to the bottom of the concave portion 4, it may be possible that a ratio d/D of the depth d to the opening diameter D of the concave portion 4 is 0. 05 to 1. Furthermore, in order to avoid the retention of cells in parts of the bottom surface 2b other than the concave portions 4, the area of the concave portions 4 occupying the bottom surface 2b may be as large as possible without deterioration of moldability, and specifically, may account for 30 to 90% of the area of the bottom surface 2b. Although the concave portions 4 may be arranged in a staggered form as shown so that the area of the concave portions 4 occupying the bottom surface 2b is as large as possible, the concave portions 4 may be arranged in a lattice form when necessary. In addition, the size of the container main body 2 is not particularly limited, but may be, for example, 50 to 500 mm in length, and 50 to 500 mm in width. Such a cell culture container 1 can be manufactured, for example, as follows. First, a top surface side plastic film serving as the top surface 2a side of the container main body 2, and a bottom surface side plastic film serving as the bottom surface 2b side of the container main body 2 are prepared. Then, the top surface side plastic film is molded so as to bulge like a plateau other than at a peripheral portion thereof. On the other hand, a plurality of concave portions 4 are molded in the bottom surface side plastic film with a predetermined arrangement. The above can be formed by general vacuum molding, air pressure molding, or the like, and can be molded so that the bulging shape and the shape of the concave portion 4 are formed into desired shapes by suitably adjusting a die or the like. Next, the top surface side plastic film and the bottom surface side plastic film that have been molded as above are laid on each other with that a tubular member to form the injection/discharge port 3 is interposed at a predetermined position, and sealed at the peripheral portions thereof by thermal welding. The peripheral portions are trimmed when necessary. Thereby, the cell culture container 1 as shown in 1A to 1C can be manufactured. In regard to the gas permeability of the plastic film that forms the container main body 2, the permeability of oxygen measured at a test temperature of 37 C. may be 5000 mL/m2dayatm or more in compliance with a gas permeability test method of JIS K 7126. Moreover, it may be possible that the plastic film partly or entirely has transparency so that the progress of cell culture, the states of cells, and the like can be checked. The material used for the plastic film that forms the container main body 2 is not particularly limited as long as the material has desired gas permeability. For example, the material includes thermoplastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyester, silicone-based elastomer, polystyrene-based elastomer, and tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer FEP. These materials may be used in a single layer, or materials of the same kind or different kinds may be used in a laminated layer. In consideration of heat fusion bonding properties during sealing the peripheral portion, a layer functioning as a sealant layer may be used. Moreover, in order to have flexibility and yet have moderate shape maintaining properties that maintain the bulging shape of the top surface 2a side and the shape of the concave portion 4, the thickness of the plastic film used to form the container main body 2 may be 30 to 200 m. Furthermore, the injection/discharge port 3 comprises a tubular member through which a culture medium and cells can circulate, as described above. The tubular member that forms the injection/discharge port 3 can be molded into a predetermined shape by injection molding, extrusion molding, or the like, using a thermoplastic resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, vinyl chloride, polystyrene-based elastomer, or FEP. In addition, the injection/discharge port 3 can be provided with a port blocking prevention piece projecting into the container main body 2 from the proximal end of the injection/discharge port 3, in order to avoid blocking of the port due to the sticking of the top surface 2a side and the bottom surface 2b side of the container main body 2. When such a port blocking prevention piece is provided, the port blocking prevention piece may be provided to be located on the top surface 2a side of the container main body 2 so as not to prevent the precipitation of cells into the concave portions 4 provided on the bottom surface 2b. When cell culture is conducted by use of such a cell culture container 1, cells to be cultured are injected into the container main body 2 together with a culture medium while a closed system is maintained via a liquid supply tube connected to the injection/discharge port 3. Then, the cells injected into the container main body 2 precipitate in the culture medium, and are thus collected to the bottom of each concave portion 4. Herein, in a flat-pouch-shaped container in which two plastic films are laid on each other with a peripheral portion only sealed, the bottom surface is deformed so that the peripheral portion is lifted as the container is filled with content liquid. On the contrary, in the present embodiment, the top surface 2a side of the container main body 2 has a bulging shape, and it is possible to restrain the deformation of the bottom surface 2b during the injection of cells to be cultured together with a culture medium, by designing the bulging shape of the top surface 2a side in such a way as to consider an injection amount. This permits cells to be uniformly stored in each concave portion 4 without inclination or the like of the concave portions 4 provided on the bottom surface 2b. In order for cells precipitating in the culture medium to be more easily collected to the bottom of each concave portion 4, it may be possible that the bottom surface 2b comprising the concave portions 4 is subjected to a cell low-adhesion treatment to make it difficult for cells to adhere. The cell low-adhesion treatment includes, for example, a treatment which gives hydrophilicity to the surface of the plastic film by a surface treatment such as a plasma treatment, and a treatment which blocks cell adhesive protein from sticking to the surface of the plastic film by coating with a phospholipid polymer, an interfacial active agent, protein such as albumin or the like. Furthermore, in order to avoid the retention of cells in parts of the bottom surface 2b other than the concave portions 4, particularly, on the peripheral portion side of the bottom surface 2b so that cells are more easily collected to the bottoms of the concave portions 4, the container main body 2 may have a bulging shape in which the bottom surface 2b side thereof is also bulged like a plateau in a manner similar to the top surface 2a side, as shown in 2A to 2C. Consequently, the rim of the bottom surface 2b is formed so as to incline and connect to the peripheral portion, and the retention of cells on the peripheral portion side of the bottom surface 2b can be avoided. Moreover, in restraining the deformation of the bottom surface 2b during the injection of cells to be cultured together with a culture medium as well, it may be possible that the bottom surface 2b side of the container main body 2 also has a bulging shape. It is to be noted that in the case of such an aspect, the bottom surface side plastic film needs only to be molded in a bulging form other than the peripheral portion thereof, and the concave portions 4 need only to be molded in the bulged part, when the cell culture container 1 is manufactured as described above. Thus, according to the cell culture container 1 in the present embodiment, cells injected into the container main body 2 precipitate in the culture medium, and are thus collected to the bottom of each concave portion 4, and can be efficiently cultured and differentiation-induced in a state of increased cell density. In addition, the container main body 2 comprises a gas-permeable plastic film, and can therefore supply sufficient amount of oxygen to the cells being cultured. Particularly, in the present embodiment, it may be possible that when the concave portions 4 are molded in the bottom surface side plastic film as described above, the plastic film is extended so that the thickness of the concave portions 4 is smaller than the thickness of the parts of the bottom surface 2b other than the concave portions 4. This makes it possible to increase the gas permeability of the concave portions 4, and thus supply more sufficient oxygen to the cells collected in the concave portions 4. Furthermore, when cells are cultured by use of the cell culture container 1, cells can be cultured under a predetermined condition in an incubator such as a CO2 incubator. In this instance, as shown in 3, the cell culture container 1 may be disposed on a table in the incubator via a jig 10 capable of supporting the bottom surface 2b side of the cell culture container 1 so as not to contact the concave portions 4. This makes it possible to certainly prevent the deformation of the concave portions 4 due to collapse or the like so that cells in a culture medium collected in the concave portions 4 do not flow out around the concave portions 4, and maximize gas permeability from the bottom surface 2b. The jig 10 capable of supporting the bottom surface 2b side of the cell culture container 1 so as not to contact the concave portions 4 includes, for example, a flat-plate-shaped jig provided with a plurality of perforations or concave portions which correspond to the arrangement of the concave portions 4 and through which the concave portions 4 can be inserted without contact, and a wire-mesh-shaped jig in which a wire material is formed in a mesh shape between the concave portions 4 so as not to contact the concave portions 4. Then, when cells collected to the bottoms of the concave portions 4 proliferate to a certain level or more and then the cell density thereof exceeds a range suited to culture, the top surface 2a is utilized as a culture surface by turning the cell culture container 1 upside down, and a culture area can be thereby enlarged. Thus, it is possible to continue cell culture while maintaining proper cell density in the same containerIt is to be noted that when cells to be cultured are anchorage-dependent cells, an enzyme solution to peel cells from the bottoms of the concave portions 4 is injected into the container main body 2 as needed at the time of turning the cell culture container 1 upside down. Even in this case, according to the present embodiment, it is possible to inject the enzyme solution into the container main body 2 while maintaining a closed system via the liquid supply tube connected to the injection/discharge port 3. Furthermore, the culture of cells normally requires a period of several days to several weeks, and in this period, culture medium have to be added or exchanged as needed. In this case, according to the present embodiment, it is also possible to easily conduct such work while maintaining a closed system, by adding or exchanging culture medium via the liquid supply tube connected to the injection/discharge port 3. Moreover, after the end of culture, it is possible to collect cells in the cell culture container 1 while maintaining a closed system via the liquid supply tube connected to the injection/discharge port 3. As described above, by conducting cell culture using the cell culture container 1 according to the present embodiment, it is possible to maintain proper cell density during culture while maintaining a closed system without conducting passage, and thus efficiently proliferate cells. Moreover, troublesome transfer work is not needed, the risk of contamination is reduced, and yet, cells can be efficiently cultured in the same container. Furthermore, the container main body 2 is formed by use of a plastic film, and is therefore light and unbulky even if increased in volume. Thus, the container main body 2 is suited to the culture of a large amount of cells, and a sufficient amount of a cell medium can be injected into the container main body 2 in advance. In addition, the size of the container main body 2 can be adjusted by use of a clamp or the like, allowing flexible adaptation depending on the number of cells and the amount of a culture medium. In contrast, a flask type culture container as in PATENT LITERATURE 2 needs to be replaced with a container having a different size for adaptation. While one or more embodiments of the present invention have been shown above to describe, the present invention is not limited to one or more embodiments described above, and it goes without saying that various changes can be made within the scope of the present invention. Those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will appreciate that various other embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims. For example, although the container main body 2 is rectangular and comprises, on one of the short sides thereof, the injection/discharge port 3 in one or more embodiments described above, the present invention is not limited thereto. The container main body 2 may have a quadrate shape, elliptical shape, circular shape, or the like in some cases, and can have various shapes as needed. The position where the injection/discharge port 3 is provided, and the number of the injection/discharge ports 3 can also be suitably changed. The entire contents of the documents described in this specification, and the specification for the Japanese application which the present application is based upon and claims from under the Paris Convention are incorporated herein by reference.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "The present invention relates to a manufacturing technique of pluripotent stem cells, and in particular to a stem cell manufacturing system, a stem cell information management system, a cell transport apparatus, and a stem cell frozen storage apparatus.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Embryonic stem cells ES cells are stem cells established from early-stage embryos of humans or mice, and they are pluripotent, or able to differentiate into any cells present in a living body. Human ES cells are considered potentially useful for cell transplantation in the treatment of many diseases such as Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, and leukemia. ES cell transplant, however, has a drawback of causing a rejection, just like organ transplants. Besides, use of ES cells is controversial from an ethical point of view because they are established by destroying human embryos. Professor Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University succeeded in establishing induced pluripotent stem cells iPS cells by introducing four genes, Oct3/4, Klf4, c-Myc, and Sox2 into somatic cells, and he was awarded a 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine see, for example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication Kokoku 4183742. Being ideal pluripotent cells that do not cause rejection nor involve ethical issues, iPS cells are received with high expectations for use in cell transplant.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "Induced stem cells like iPS cells are established by introducing inducing factors such as genes into cells, and then expanded and cryopreserved. However, there are problems as described below in producing iPS cells for clinical application GLP, GMP grades on an industrial scale. 1 ExpensesiPS cells for clinical application are produced and cryopreserved preferably in a clean room that is kept very clean. However, clean rooms are very expensive to maintain. Using clean rooms efficiently to reduce costs is a task to be addressed in achieving industrial use of iPS cells. 2 QualityThe processes from establishing stem cells to cryopreserving them involve a series of complicated work carried out by hand. Besides, production of stem cells depends much on individual skills. Accordingly, qualities of iPS cells can vary depending on the individuals engaged in the production of cells. Qualities also vary day by day during the cell production. The qualities of iPS cells also depend on the qualities of the somatic cells from which they are derived. It is therefore important to properly manage the time and the temperature for transportation of somatic cells until they are received, to properly manage characteristics of somatic cell donors sex, age, anamnesis, genetic background, and the like, and to properly manage combinations of these various different pieces of information. 3 TimeTo avoid cross contamination of somatic cells or iPS cells among different individuals, iPS cells are produced in a clean room for only one individual at one time. In addition, it takes a long time to establish iPS cells and to evaluate the quality of established cells. It would take many years to produce iPS cells for many individuals in want of iPS cells by producing iPS cells for each of the individuals in one room. Thus a system capable of concurrently producing iPS cells for a plurality of individuals in want of iPS cells is desired. Furthermore, since cultured cells are living, they will die unless delivered, processed and frozen at appropriate timings. Especially in a concurrent production of iPS cells, unless integrated management is in place to control all the schedules including collecting somatic cells, establishing iPS cells, and cryopreserving them, it is not possible to timely provide iPS cells for many individuals in want of them. 4 ContaminationThe first and foremost pollutants in clean rooms are humans, and their removal from the rooms is the first priority. In addition, even if iPS cells for a plurality of individuals in want are successfully produced on a large scale and concurrently, contamination remains difficult to prevent unless all the processes, including collecting somatic cells, establishing stem cells, and cryopreserving them, are arranged to be completed in a closed system. Besides, concurrent manufacturing of cells will increase the risk of erroneous identification of manufacturing samples and cross contamination. 5 Human ResourcesAs described above, much of the work for producing iPS cells is carried out by hand, and only a few experts can produce iPS cells for clinical application. The problem is that the processes from establishing stem cells to cryopreserving them involve a series of complicated work. Culturing cells for clinical application involves three steps, i. e. , checking the standard operation procedure SOP, operation according to the SOP, and checking whether the operation has been conducted in accordance with the SOP. It is very inefficient for humans to execute these steps. Human execution of these steps may lead to erroneous identification of somatic cells of a plurality of individuals in want of iPS cells, erroneous identification of culture reagents or materials for producing iPS cells, or human errors including procedural errors. Furthermore, since cell culture involves management for 24 hours every day and stem cells are cryopreserved for decades, there is a limit on what human efforts can do to achieve adequate management. Therefore, there is a desire for a technique for producing and cryopreserving stem cells in a timely manner while preventing contamination, based on an inexpensive but sophisticated quality management.

Throughout the drawings, identical or similar parts are denoted by identical or similar numerals. The embodiments described below are not intended to limit in any way the technical scope of the invention described in the appended claims or the meaning of words used therein. 1.

Released vials 103 are transported to one or more cryopreservation devices 120 in a timely manner and cryopreserved. Although a system in which iPS cells are produced from blood cells will be described according to the present embodiment, it should be understood that the invention can be applied to a system in which iPS cells are produced from skin-derived cells, a system in which somatic stem cells are produced from other somatic cells, a system in which stem cells are produced from animal cells, and other systems. As illustrated in 1, the stem cell manufacturing system 100 includes a drive device 130 configured to drive a closed production device 101 in such a manner as to maintain the production device in an environment suitable for producing stem cells. The stem cell manufacturing system 100 further includes a conveyer device 140 configured to convey at least one of a plurality of kinds of vials 102 to 105 preserved in a preservation device 150 to the production device 101, a conveyer device 141 configured to convey the production device 101 to the drive device 130 or conveys the drive device 130 to the production device 101, and a conveyer device 142 configured to convey a stem cell freezing vial 103 released from the production device 101 to a cryopreservation device 120. These conveyer devices 140 to 142 are robots autonomously performing work according to a teaching program, but according to another embodiment these conveyer devices 140 to 142 may be a belt conveyer system. According to still another embodiment, two or three of the conveyer devices 140 to 142 are formed in a unitary body. Referring to 1, the stem cell manufacturing system 100 includes a control device 160 connected with the drive device 130, the conveyer devices 140 to 142, and the cryopreservation device 120 by wired or wireless communication and controlling the drive device 130, the conveyer devices 140 to 142, and the cryopreservation device 120. The control device 160 is also connected with a superordinate computer 170 on a cloud by wired or wireless communication and has access to various pieces of information acquired in all the processes except the manufacturing process, i. e. , in the entry process, the transport process, the examination process, and the stock process. The superordinate computer 170 includes at least an entry memory device see 15, numeral 202 configured to store information on the somatic cell donor upon receiving a request for manufacturing stem cells. The superordinate computer 170 transmits various pieces of information such as an abnormality alarm to a mobile terminal 180 in a remote location. The mobile terminal 180 may be, for example, a smart phone of the somatic cell donor. As illustrated in 2, the vials include a somatic cell collection vial 102 containing collected somatic cells, a stem cell freezing vial 103 containing frozen stem cells, a culture reagent vial 104 containing a culture reagent, and a stem cell production material vial 105 containing a material other than the culture reagent used for producing stem cells. Although only four kinds of vials 102 to 104 are illustrated in 2 to facilitate understanding, a plurality of kinds of vials actually exist. These vials 102 to 104 are equipped with an individual identification device 106 for identifying individuals. The individual identification device 106 may be a semi-conductor chip using RFID or the like, one-dimension code such as the barcode, or a two-dimensional code such as QR Code registered trademark or SP Code. The individual identification device 106 as illustrated in 2 at least includes a donor ID identifying a somatic cell donor.

Donor information includes, for example, informed consent, nationality, address, sex, age, blood type, anamnesis, prescription history, health check results, and the family members from whom stem cells were produced in the past, of the somatic cell donor. According to another embodiment, the individual identification device 106 may contain such donor information, and in that case, the donor information is encrypted. In addition to the donor ID, the individual identification device 106 illustrated in 2 includes at least one of an entry ID for identifying a taking of a request for manufacturing stem cells, a transport ID for identifying a transport of vials, an acceptance ID for identifying an acceptance of vials, a manufacturer ID for identifying a stem cell manufacturer, a production device ID for identifying a production device, a cryopreservation device ID for identifying a cryopreservation device, and a stock site ID for identifying a stock site in which the cryopreservation device is to be stocked. This ensures traceability in case of abnormality in each of the processes from receiving a request for manufacturing stem cells to stocking stem cells. Based on the production device ID read from the vial, the conveyer device 140 illustrated in 1 identifies the production device 101 to which the somatic cell collection vial 102 will be conveyed. Similarly, based on the drive device ID read from the vial, the conveyer device 141 conveys the production device 101 to the drive device 130 or conveys the drive device 130 to the production device 101. Further, based on the cryopreservation device ID read from the vial, the conveyer device 142 conveys the stem cell freezing vial 103 to the cryopreservation device 120. As illustrated in 1, the conveyer device 140 further includes a vision sensor 143 for acquiring data to be used for inputting whether or not the somatic cell collection vial 102 has been introduced to the production device 101 a first state, and transmits the acquired information indicating the first state to the control device 160. The conveyer device 141 includes a vision sensor 144 for acquiring data to be used for inputting whether or not the production device 101 is connected with the drive device 130 a second state, and transmits the acquired information indicating the second state to the control device 160.

According to still another embodiment, such a display device is not the drive device 130 but may be a liquid crystal monitor provided for the control device 160, a manufacturing process management terminal see 15 and 16, or the like. The drive device 130 also stores at least one of the normal range and the abnormal range of the fourth state in the memory 131 as first information. 9 is a flow chart illustrating an operation of the stem cell manufacturing system 100 according to the present embodiment, based on the fourth state. When the drive device 130 has determined that the stem cells are not being produced in a normal condition i. e. , information indicating the fourth state , the ratio of stem cell clusters having a size not less than 100 m after the initial culture, or the ratio of stem cell clusters having a size of not more than 30 m in 14 days is out of the stored normal range or within the abnormal range not less than 80% step S110, the drive device 130 stores the information indicating the fourth state in the memory 131, in association with the donor ID read from the vial step S111.

Referring once again to 1, the conveyer device 140, by using the vision sensor 143, stores respective inventory quantities of the vials 102 to 105 preserved in the preservation device 150 and respective arrival schedules of the vials 102 to 105 as a fifth state in the memory 146, and transmits information indicating the fifth state to the control device 160. The control device 160 stores the received information indicating the fifth state in a memory 161. According to another embodiment, the preservation device 150, by using the vision sensor 151, may store respective inventory quantities of the vials 102 to 105 preserved in the preservation device 150 and respective arrival schedules of the vials 102 to 105 as a fifth state in the memory 152, and transmit the information indicating the fifth state to the control device 160 by wired or wireless communication. 11 is a flow chart illustrating an operation of the stem cell manufacturing system 100 according to the present embodiment, based on the sixth state.

When there is a difference between the predefined standard state and information indicating at least one of the first to the fifth states step S132, the control device 160 outputs a second abnormality alarm in association with the donor ID and transmits the second abnormality alarm to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location via the superordinate computer 170 step S133.

The cryopreservation device 120 further includes a vision sensor 127 for acquiring data in the cryopreservation device 120 and, based on the data from the vision sensor 127, stores in the memory 122 whether or not the stem cells are being stored in a normal condition see 6 as a seventh state in numerical form. Such a seventh state may be, for example, the presence or absence of stem cells or the presence or absence of frozen liquid in the stem cell freezing vials 103. The cryopreservation device 120 also includes a temperature sensor 128 configured to detect temperature in the cryopreservation device 120 and, based on the temperature from the temperature sensor 128, stores in the memory 122 whether or not the stem cells are being stored in a normal condition as a seventh state in a numerical from. Such a seventh state in numerical form may be, for example, resistance and voltage of the temperature sensor, or temperature obtained from these. Stem cells are preferably stored at temperatures at 160 C. or lower, and may sustain a serious damage or may perish when they undergo a temperature change of about 20 C. The cryopreservation device 120 further includes a refrigerant remaining amount sensor 129 configured to detect the remaining amount of refrigerant in the cryopreservation device 120 and, based on the remaining amount from the refrigerant remaining amount sensor 129, stores in the memory whether or not the stem cells are being stored in a normal condition as a seventh state in a numerical from. Such a seventh state may be, for example, voltage or resistance of the remaining amount sensor. The cryopreservation device 120 stores at least one of the normal range and the abnormal range of the seventh state as second information in the memory 122. 12 is a flow chart illustrating an operation of the stem cell manufacturing system 100 according to the present embodiment, based on the seventh state. When the cryopreservation device 120 has determined that the stem cells are not being stored in a normal condition i. e. , when the information indicating the seventh state , the temperature from the temperature sensor is out of the normal range or within the abnormal range over 160 C. stored in memory step S140, the cryopreservation device 120 stores the information indicating the seventh state in the memory 122 in association with the donor ID read from the vial step S141. The cryopreservation device 120 then outputs a third abnormality alarm in association with the donor ID and transmits the third abnormality alarm to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location via the control device 160 and the superordinate computer 170 step S142. 13 is a flow chart illustrating an operation of the stem cell manufacturing system 100 according to the present embodiment, based on the eighth state. The control device 160 stores the operation record of at least one of the conveyer devices 140 to 142, the drive device 130, and the cryopreservation device 120 the eighth state in the memory 161 in association with the donor ID step S150. The control device 160 then compares the eighth state with a predefined standard state , a standard operation procedure SOP step S151, and stores in the memory 161 the presence or absence of a difference the sixth state in association with the donor ID step S152. When there is a difference between the eighth state and the predefined standard state step S153, the control device 160 outputs a second abnormality alarm in association with the donor ID and transmits the second abnormality alarm to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location via the superordinate computer 170 step S154. According to another embodiment, the conveyer devices 140 to 142, the drive device 130, and the cryopreservation device 120 store in memory respective operation records the eighth state in association with the donor ID and compares the eighth state with the predefined standard state SOP, and the control device 160 stores the presence or absence of a difference the sixth state in association with the donor ID in the memory 161. The memory that stores at least one of the above-described first to the eighth states may be a single memory provided in a single housing, i. e. , the control device or the superordinate computer 170. At least one of the first to the eighth states is transmitted by wireless communication to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location. 7 is a functional block diagram of an application of the FIELD system to the stem cell manufacturing system 100 according to the present embodiment. The stem cell manufacturing system 100 further includes a control device 160 including interface software 163 and work software 164, and input devices in wired or wireless communication with the control device 160 and configured to input information in the manufacturing process. The input devices may be, for example, the above-described drive device 130, the cryopreservation device 120, and conveyer devices 140 to 142. According to another embodiment, the input devices may be, for example, input devices configured to manually input information indicating at least one of the first to the eighth states. The control device 160, for example, receives inputs of electric current values of the first to the fourth pumps, voltage values of the first to the third switches, data from the vision sensor, and the like from moment to moment from one or more drive devices 130, receives inputs of resistance values of the temperature sensor, temperature data of the temperature estimation unit, impedance of a somatic cell coagulation monitoring device, voltage values of the refrigerant remaining amount sensor, data from the vision sensor and the like from moment to moment from one or more cryopreservation devices 120, and receives inputs of electric current values of servo motors for respective axes, data from a vision sensor, and the like from moment to moment from the conveyer device 140. Since a large number of input devices of many kinds send out pieces of information unique to a large number of components of many kinds, the control device 160 cannot recognize, for example, by which pump of which drive device working with which production device a certain flow rate is produced. To address this, the interface software 163 converts the information formatted in data formats unique to the input devices into information formatted in a data format unique to the work software 164. The data format unique to the work software 164 is formed with data models having a data structure of tree type or network type indicating subordination relationship of the components of each input device, and the various data models are stored in the memory 161 of the control device 160 in advance. To facilitate understanding, for example, an electric current value of the first pump of the drive device 130, a piece of information unique to the input device, is converted to drive device ID/production device ID/first pump/electric current value/flow rate, which is in a structured data format unique to the work software. This conversion gives the work software 164 an instant access to data unique to a large number of components of many kinds in a large number of input devices of many kinds. According to the above-described stem cell manufacturing system 100, a plurality of closed production devices 101 enable the production of stem cells for a plurality of individuals in want of stem cells on a large scale and concurrently, and the closed FA system, which does not need clean rooms, achieves cost reduction, sophisticated quality control, contamination prevention, and solution of human resource shortage. Furthermore, by applying the FIELD system, the time for producing stem cells is reduced. In addition, by reading various identification information attached to each vial, the stem cell manufacturing system 100 prevents cross contamination with somatic cells or stem cells of other individuals. The stem cell manufacturing system 100 makes a great contribution especially for developing an industry in the area of iPS cells for clinical use. 2. Stem Cell Information Management System 14 is a schematic diagram illustrating a server-based configuration of a stem cell information management system 200 according to the present embodiment. The stem cell information management system 200 includes a server apparatus 201 on a cloud, and is constituted by a cloud system that performs an integral control of big data in an entry process of receiving a request for manufacturing stem cells from somatic cells, a transport process of transporting somatic cells collected from a somatic cell donor or stem cells produced from somatic cells, an examination process of examining somatic cells or stem cells, a manufacturing process of manufacturing stem cells from somatic cells, and a stock process of stocking stem cells. Such a server apparatus 201 corresponds to the superordinate computer 170 in other drawings. Although a system in which iPS cells are produced from blood cells will be described according to the present embodiment, it should be understood that the invention can be applied to a system in which iPS cells are produced from skin-derived cells, a system in which ES cells are produced from embryonic cells, and other systems. An outline of the processing performed by the stem cell information management system 200 will be described first. In the entry process, upon receiving a request for manufacturing stem cells, the server apparatus 201 determines all the schedules from the stem cells entry process to the stock process such that stem cells will be produced in a shortest route possible and in a shortest time possible. Upon receiving the request, the server apparatus 201 stores in the memory unit 202 donor information including at least one of informed consent, nationality, address, sex, age, blood type, anamnesis, prescription history, health check results, and family members from whom stem cells are produced in the past, of the somatic cell donor, in association with a donor ID. A collection kit 209 including one or more somatic cell collection vials 102 with the donor ID is then sent specifically to the somatic cell donor himself or herself, which prevents handling of the donor's cells in mistake for somatic cells or stem cells of another individual and failure to attach the correct donor ID to his or her collected cells. According to another embodiment, such a collection kit 209 may be sent not only to the somatic cell donor himself or herself but to the institution at which his or her somatic cells are collected, in advance. The somatic cell collection vial 102 includes an individual identification device 106 that contains, in addition to a donor ID, at least one of an entry ID, a transport ID, an acceptance ID, a manufacturer ID, a production device ID, a cryopreservation device ID, and a stock site ID, as illustrated in 2. In the transport process of somatic cells, one or more somatic cell collection vials 102 are placed in a transport container 250, and the transport container 250 is transported from a collection institution to an examination institution and from the examination institution to a stem cell manufacture by transportation means including at least one of automobile, railway, aircraft, ship, and robot. At the time of transport, information on the temperature in the transport container 250, accumulated transportation time, vibration and coagulation state of the somatic cells and the like is transmitted to the server apparatus 201, and the server apparatus 201 performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. In the examination process of somatic cells, a viral or bacteriological test, a test for blood cell counting, a test for gene expression level measurement, and other tests are conducted on the collected somatic cells. At the time of examination, results of these tests are sent to the server apparatus 201, and the server apparatus 201 performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. In particular, the server apparatus 201 is characterized by that the server apparatus 201 determines a predicted reprogramming rate, which serves as an indicator as to whether or not the somatic cells can be reprogrammed, based on correlation data accumulated from past donors between age, anamnesis, presence or absence of family members from whom stem cells were produced in the past, blood cell count, and presence or absence and measurement of expression of particular genes on one hand and the reprogramming data of the somatic cells on the other, and performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. In the manufacturing process, information indicating the above-described first state to the eighth states in the stem cell manufacturing system 200 is sent to the server apparatus 201, and the server apparatus 201 performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. When the production device 101 fails to release a stem cell freezing vial 103 in accordance with the predicted release date and time initially set by the server apparatus 201 at the time of receiving the request, the server apparatus 201 performs tasks such as outputting an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. In the transport process of stem cells, stem cell freezing vials 103 containing stem cells manufactured by the stem cell manufacturer are placed in the transport container 250 and transported by transportation means including at least one of automobile, railway, aircraft, ship, and robot. The transport container 250 includes a cryopreservation device 120 containing the above-described refrigerant, but the refrigerant in the cryopreservation device 120 is released through a safety valve as time elapses and the cryopreservation device 120 accordingly has a short-time cryopreservation function only. At the time of transport, information regarding not only temperature in the cryopreservation device 120, accumulated transportation time, vibration, but also remaining amount of refrigerant or remaining amount of reserved refrigerant is sent to the server apparatus 201, and the server apparatus 201 performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. In the stock process, one or more cryopreservation devices 120 are stocked in the storehouse of a stem cell stock site and refrigerant is stably supplied to the one or more cryopreservation devices 120. The stem cell stock site accordingly has a long-term cryopreservation function. During stock, temperature in the cryopreservation device 120, remaining amount of refrigerant as well as presence or absence of stem cells or presence or absence of frozen liquid and the like are sent to the server apparatus 201, and the server apparatus 201 performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. In the examination process of stem cells, genomic information tests of somatic cells and stem cells, HLA typing tests of somatic cells and stem cells, and other tests are conducted. At the time of examination, information on test results is transmitted to the server apparatus 201, which performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. In particular, the server apparatus 201 is characterized in that the server apparatus 201 determines whether or not the somatic cells and the stem cells are from the same individual, based on the genomic information and the HLA types of the somatic cells and the stem cells, and performs tasks such as issuing an abnormality alarm and modifying the schedules. 15 is a block diagram illustrating a server-based configuration of the stem cell information management system 200 according to the present embodiment.

According to another embodiment, the determination unit 203 may determine the schedule based on a supply schedule of the culture reagent and stem cell production material. As illustrated in 15, the stem cell information management system 200 further includes an entry management terminal 210 connected with the server apparatus 201 by wired or wireless communication and receiving a request for manufacturing stem cells, an acceptance management terminal 220 that manages acceptance of somatic cells, a manufacturing process management terminal 230 for managing manufacturing process, and a stock management terminal 240 for managing the stocking of stem cells. The acceptance management terminal 220 stores collectable dates of collecting institutions and examinable dates of examination institutions in the memory unit 211 in advance, and the stock management terminal 240 stores stockable locations and stockable periods of stem cell stock sites in the memory unit 241 in advance. According to the present embodiment, these terminal apparatuses 210 to 240 are disposed in a stem cell manufacturer illustrated in 14, but according to another embodiment they may be disposed in other locations or be formed in a single housing. 17 illustrates a sequence of an operation of the stem cell information management system 200 according to the present embodiment. The server apparatus 201 receives collectable dates on which somatic cells can be collected and examinable dates on which somatic cells can be inspected from the acceptance management terminal 220 in advance and stores these dates in the memory unit 202 step S200. According to another embodiment, the server apparatus 201 may directly receive collectable dates from the collecting institutions and examinable dates from the examination institutions. The server apparatus 201 further receives producible periods of one or more closed production devices 101 from the manufacturing process management terminal 230 in advance and stores the periods in the memory unit 202 step S201. Further, the server apparatus 201 receives stockable locations and stockable periods from the stock management terminal 240 in advance and stores the stockable locations and stockable periods in the memory unit 202 step S202. According to another embodiment, the server apparatus 201 may directly receive stockable locations and stockable periods from the stock sites. When the server apparatus 201 receives a manufacturing request including desired collection dates, together with the donor ID from the entry management terminal 210 step S203, the server apparatus 201 determines a collection date of somatic cells, based on whether or not the one of the desired collection dates falls upon one of the collectable dates step S204. The server apparatus 201 further determines a transport date such that a collection kit 209 will be transported seven days prior to the determined collection date step S205. Further, the server apparatus 201 determines an examination date of somatic cells, based on whether or not the date obtained by adding two days for transporting the somatic cells to the determined collection date falls upon one of the examinable dates step S206. The server apparatus 201 further determines an acceptance date of somatic cells at a stem cell manufacturer, based on whether or not the date obtained by adding seven days for examining the somatic cells and two days for transporting the somatic cells to the determined date of somatic cell examination falls within an producible period of one or more closed production devices 101 step S207. Further, the server apparatus 201 determines a stem cell production period such that the manufacturing of stem cells may be started immediately from the determined acceptance date of somatic cells step S208. In other words, the server apparatus 201 determines a stem cell production period based on the determined collection date of somatic cells and the stored producible periods of one or more closed production devices 101. At the time of receiving a request, the server apparatus 201 initially sets a predicted release date and time of the stem cell freezing vials 103 to be released from the closed production devices 101 on a date three months after the date of starting the production. The server apparatus 201 then determines a cryopreservation period, based on whether or not the predicted release date and time of the stem cell freezing vials 103 falls within an cryopreservable period of one or more cryopreservation devices 120 step S208. The server apparatus 201 then determines a stock location and a stock period of stem cells, based on whether or not the date obtained by adding four days for transporting the stem cells to the predicted release date and time of the stem cell freezing vials 103 falls within a stockable period of the most closely located stockable location among the stockable sites stored in memory step S209. The server apparatus 201 determines a stem cell shipping date, based on the determined production period and the stockable locations and stockable periods stored in memory step S210. The server apparatus 201 stores in the memory unit 202 the determined collection date of somatic cells, the transport date of transporting a collection kit 209, the examination date of somatic cells, the acceptance date of somatic cells, the production period of stem cells, the cryopreservation period of stem cells, the stock location and stock period of stem cells, and the shipping date of stem cells in association with the donor ID step S211 and transmits these dates, locations and periods to the somatic cell donor represented by the donor ID step S212. According to another embodiment, the server apparatus 201 may determine a cryopreservation period during which somatic cells are temporarily cryopreserved after it has decided the acceptance date of somatic cells in step S207. The cryopreservation period may include, for example, a period for preserving peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from the blood. Referring to 19 to 22, how to determine the schedules in the above-described steps S204 to S211 will be described in detail. 19 to 22 illustrate a relational database including a donors master 500, a collecting institutions master 501, an examination institutions master 502, a manufactures master 503, a production devices master 504, a cryopreservation devices master 505, an entry table 506, an acceptance table 507, production table 58, a cryopreservation table 509, a stock site master 510, and a stock table 511, stored in the memory unit of the server apparatus 201. In the following, a case of the entry ID 0001 of the entry table 506 in 21 will be described. In step S204, the donors master 500 in 19 provides an address corresponding to the donor ID 0102, the collecting institutions master 501 in 19 reveals that the collecting institution at the collection site most closely located to this address is the one with a collecting institution ID 0001, and the second desired collection date 2018 Mar. 16 in the entry table 506 in 21 falls upon the first collectable date 2018 Mar. 16 in the collecting institutions master 501 in 19; therefore, the server apparatus 201 determines that the collection date of somatic cells is to be 2018 Mar. 16. In step S205, by selecting a date seven days prior to the collection date of somatic cells 2018 Mar. 16 specified in the entry table 506 in 21, the server apparatus 201 determines that the transport date of the collection kit 209 is to be 2018 Mar. 9. In step S206, by adding to the collection date of somatic cells 2018 Mar. 16 two days for transporting the somatic cells, the date 2018 Mar. 18 is obtained, which falls upon the second examinable dates 2018 Mar. 18 of the most closely located examination institution in the examination institutions master 502 in 19; therefore, the server apparatus 201 determines that the examination date of somatic cells is to be 2018 Mar. 18. In step S207, referring to the entry table 506 in 21, by adding seven days for examining the somatic cells and two days for transporting the somatic cells to the examination date of somatic cells 2018 Mar. 18, the date 2018 Mar. 27 is obtained, and this date falls within the producible period from 2018 Mar. 16 to 2018 Mar. 16 corresponding to the manufacturer ID 0001 specified in the production table 508 in 22; therefore, the server apparatus 201 determines that the acceptance date of somatic cells is to be 2018 Mar. 27, as illustrated in the acceptance table 507 in 21. In the case of the entry ID 0003 in the entry table 506 in 21, however, by adding seven days for examining the somatic cells and two days for transporting the somatic cells to the examination date of somatic cells 2018 Mar. 27, the date 2018 Apr. 5 is obtained, which does not fall within the producible period corresponding to the manufacturer ID 0003 specified in the production table 508 in 20; therefore, the server apparatus 201 issues an alarm for rearranging the schedules, as illustrated in the production table 508 in 22, and prompts an inquiry of the somatic cell donor for other desired collection dates. Returning to the case of the entry ID 0001, in step S208, the server apparatus 201 determines that the production period is to be from 2018 Mar. 27 to 2018 Mar. 16 as illustrated in the production table 508 in 22 so that the production of the stem cells may be started immediately from the acceptance date of somatic cells 2018 Mar. 27. In step S209, the server apparatus 201 sets the predicted release date and time of the stem cell freezing vial in 22 on 2018 Jun. 27, which is three months after the production starting date 2018 Mar. 27. Since the predicted release date and time 2018 Jun. 27 falls within an cryopreservable period from 2018 Jun. 18 to 2018 Jul. 17 in the cryopreservation devices master 505 in 20, the server apparatus 201 determines that the cryopreservation period is to be from 2018 Jun. 27 to 2018 Jul. 17, as illustrated in the cryopreservation table 509 in 22. In the case of the entry ID 0002 in the production table 508 in 22, however, the predicted release date and time 2018 Jul. 2 does not fall within any of cryopreservable periods for the manufacturer ID 0002 in the cryopreservation devices master 505 in 20, the server apparatus 201 issues an alarm for rearranging the schedules, as illustrated in the cryopreservation table 509 in 22, and prompts an inquiry of the somatic cell donor for other desired collection dates. Returning to the case of the entry ID 0001, in step S210, by adding to the predicted release date and time 2018 Jun. 27 in the production table in 22 four days for transport, the date 2018 Jul. 1 is obtained, which date falls within an stockable period 2018 Jun. 16 of the LA stock site at the most closely located stock location of the stockable locations in the stock site master 510 in 22; therefore, the server apparatus 201 determines that the stock location is to be the LA stock site and that the stock period is to be 50 years starting from 2018 Jul. 1. In step S211, the server apparatus 201 determines that the shipping date of stem cells is to be 2018 Jun. 27, which is the predicted release date and time. 16 is a block diagram illustrating a medium-based configuration of a stem cell information management system 260 according to another embodiment. The stem cell information management system 260 differs from the server-based configuration of the stem cell information management system 260 only insofar as it does not use the server apparatus 201, and otherwise the configuration is the same as the server-based configuration. The stem cell information management system 260 transfers various information among terminal apparatuses 210 to 240 by paper medium or telecommunication medium. Since the stem cell information management system 260 does not use the server apparatus 201 on a cloud, it is secure and prevents personal information from being leaked. The stem cell information management system 260 includes an entry management terminal 210, an acceptance management terminal 220, a manufacturing process management terminal 230, and a stock management terminal 240, connected with one another by wired or wireless communication. The terminal apparatuses 210 to 240 respectively include determination units 212, 222, 232, 242 that determine various information such as schedules and memory units 211, 221, 231, 241 that store various data. 18 illustrates a sequence of an operation of the stem cell information management system 260. The acceptance management terminal 210 stores collectable dates of the collecting institutions and examinable dates of the examination institutions in the memory unit 221 in advance step S220, outputs the collectable dates and the examinable dates to a second medium and communicates the dates to the entry management terminal 210 step S221. The manufacturing process management terminal 230 stores producible periods of the production devices in the memory unit 231 in advance step S222, outputs the producible periods to a third medium step S223, and communicates the periods to the acceptance management terminal 220 step S224. The stock management terminal 240 stores stockable locations and stockable periods of the stock sites in the memory unit 241 in advance step S225, outputs the stockable locations and the stockable periods to a fifth medium step S226, and communicates the stockable locations and stockable periods to the manufacturing process management terminal 230 step S227. When the entry management terminal 210 receives a manufacturing request including desired collection dates together with the donor ID step S228, the entry management terminal 210 determines a collection date of somatic cells, based on whether or not one of the desired collection dates falls upon one of the collectable dates communicated by the second medium step S229. The entry management terminal 210 further determines a transport date such that a collection kit 209 will be transported seven days before the determined collection date step S229. The entry management terminal 210 also determines an examination date of somatic cells, based on whether or not the date obtained by adding two days for transportation to the determined collection date falls upon one of the examinable dates communicated by the second medium step S229. The entry management terminal 210 outputs the determined collection date and the examination date to a first medium step S230, and communicates the dates to the acceptance management terminal 220 and the manufacturing process management terminal 230 step S231. The acceptance management terminal 220 determines an acceptance date of somatic cells, based on whether or not the date obtained by adding seven days for examining the somatic cells and two days for transporting the somatic cells to the examination date communicated by the first medium falls within one of the producible periods communicated by the third medium step S232. In other words, the acceptance management terminal 220 determines an acceptance date of somatic cells, based on the determined collection date and the producible periods communicated by the third medium. The manufacturing process management terminal 230 determines an acceptance date of somatic cells by the same procedure as the entry management terminal 210 step S233. The manufacturing process management terminal 230 determines a stem cell production period so that the production of the stem cells may be started immediately from the determined acceptance date of somatic cells step S234. In other words, the manufacturing process management terminal 230 determines a stem cell production period, based on the collection date of somatic cells communicated by the first medium and the producible periods stored in memory. Further, the manufacturing process management terminal 230 initially sets a predicted release date and time of the stem cell freezing vial to be released from the closed production device on the date three months after the production starting date, and determines a cryopreservation period, based on whether or not the predicted release date and time falls within an cryopreservable period of the cryopreservation device step S234. The manufacturing process management terminal 230 then determines a shipping date of stem cells, based on whether or not the date obtained by adding four days for transporting the stem cells to the predicted release date and time falls within an stockable period of the most closely located stockable location of the stockable locations communicated by the fifth medium step S234. In other words, the manufacturing process management terminal 230 determines a shipping date of stem cells, based on the production period of stem cells and the stock locations and stock periods communicated by the fifth medium. The manufacturing process management terminal 230 outputs the determined production period and the cryopreservation period to a fourth medium step S235, and communicates these periods to the stock management terminal 240 step S236. The stock management terminal 240 determines a stock location and stock period of stem cells by the same procedure as the manufacturing process management terminal 230 step S237. In other words, the stock management terminal 240 determines a stock location and stock period of stem cells, based on the production period of stem cells communicated by the fourth medium and the stockable locations and stockable periods stored in memory. The entry management terminal 210 stores the determined collection date, the transport date of transporting a collection kit, the examination date of somatic cells, and the like in the memory unit 211 in association with the donor ID, and transmits these dates to the donor step S239. Similarly, the acceptance management terminal 220 stores the determined acceptance date of somatic cells in the memory unit 221 in association with the donor ID, and transmits the date to the donor step S240. Similarly, the manufacturing process management terminal 230 stores the determined production period, the cryopreservation period, and the shipping date in the memory unit 231 in association with the donor ID, and transmits the periods and the date to the donor step S241. The stock management terminal 240 stores the determined stock location and stock period in the memory unit 241 in association with the donor ID, and transmits the stock location and stock period to the donor step S242. According to the stem cell information management systems 200, 260, in either server-based or medium-based configuration, when a manufacturing request is received, the determination unit of the server apparatus 201 determines or the determination units of the terminal apparatuses 210 to 240 determine a production schedule of stem cells according to the shortest route and the shortest time, which shortens the production time and provides a sophisticated quality control. In the following, modification of a schedule in response to an abnormality in the transport process, the examination process, and the manufacturing process will be described based on the stem cell information management system 200 with the server-based configuration. 23 to 27 illustrate a configuration and an operation of the stem cell information management system 200 in the transport process. As illustrated in 23, the stem cell information management system 200 further includes a transport container 250 configured to contain one or more somatic cell collection vials. The transport container 250 includes at least one of a heating and cooling device 253 connected with a temperature sensor 251 and a heating and cooling module 252, an accumulated time measurement device 254 measuring accumulated transportation time of the transport container 250, a somatic cell coagulation monitoring device 255 monitoring the coagulating state of the somatic cells in the somatic cell collection vial, and a vibration monitoring device 256 monitoring vibration of the transport container 250. The transport container 250 further includes a memory 275 storing various data, a communication control unit in a wireless communication with a superordinate computer, and a CPU 258 that controls the whole transport container 250. As illustrated in 24, the heating and cooling device 253 includes a temperature estimation unit 259 estimating the temperature of the somatic cells in the transport container 250, and a heating and cooling unit 260 automatically performing heating or cooling in conjunction with the temperature data from the temperature estimation unit so that the temperature may be kept constant. The temperature estimation unit 259 estimates the temperature of the somatic cells, based on the temperature from the temperature sensor 251 and the thermal conductivity of the somatic cell collection vial 102. The heating and cooling unit 260 outputs electric current to a heating and cooling module 252 so that the temperature data for the temperature estimation unit 259 may be equal to a target temperature , 4 C. . Further, the heating and cooling device 253 stores in memory an upper temperature limit and a lower temperature limit, and issues a temperature-related abnormality alarm when the temperature data from the temperature estimation unit 259 is equal to or higher than the upper temperature limit or equal to or lower than the lower temperature limit. The accumulated time measurement device 254 includes a timer device not illustrated with a start function and a stop function, and measures accumulated transportation time starting from the collection date and time of the somatic cells or the release of the stem cell freezing vials 103. The accumulated time measurement device 254 stores in memory a time period during which the quality of the somatic cells or the stem cells can be maintained and outputs a time-related abnormality alarm when the accumulated transportation time exceeds the time period during which the quality can be maintained. As illustrated in 25, the somatic cell coagulation monitoring device 255 includes, an alternative current production unit 276 producing alternative current, an impedance measurement unit 277 measuring impedance from the alternative current applied to the somatic cells, and a somatic cell coagulation monitoring unit 278 monitoring the state of somatic cell coagulation, based on the correlation data between the impedance and the state of somatic cell coagulation stored in memory in advance. The somatic cell coagulation monitoring device 255 stores in memory an upper limit and a lower limit for a numerical value representing the state of coagulation , impedance, or somatic cell coagulation value calculated from impedance, and outputs an coagulation-related abnormality alarm when the value of somatic cell coagulation is equal to or greater than the upper limit or equal to or smaller than the lower limit. The vibration monitoring device 256 is provided with a vibration sensor 257 configured to detect vibration of the transport container 250 displacement in three-dimension directions, velocity, acceleration, or force, and outputs a vibration-related abnormality alarm when a numerical value representing vibration detected by the vibration sensor 257 , the integral of the absolute value of acceleration with respect to time, as a value having a correlation with a total energy of vibration exceeds an upper limit. 26 illustrates a transport table 512 containing transport information and 27 illustrates an operation of the stem cell information management system 200, based on the transport information. The transport container 250 stores in a memory 275 transport information including at least one of the above-described temperature data, accumulated transportation time, a numerical value representing the state of coagulation, a numerical value representing the vibration in association with at least the donor ID, and transmits the transport information to the server apparatus 201 serving as the superordinate computer 170 step S230. When at least one of the temperature data step S231, the accumulated transportation time step S232, the numerical value representing the state of coagulation step S233, and the numerical value representing the vibration step S234 is out of the normal range, the server apparatus 201 determines to output an alarm for an abnormality at the time of transport and modify the schedule step S235, and transmits an alarm for an abnormality at the time of transport and the transport information to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location step S236. 28 to 30 illustrate a configuration and an operation of the stem cell information management system 200 in the examination process of somatic cells. As illustrated in 28, the stem cell information management system 200 further includes a first examination device 285 configured to perform examination as to whether or not the collected somatic cells can be easily reprogrammed, and the first examination device 285 includes at least one of a somatic cell counting device 286 for counting somatic cells , the number of T cells in 1 ml of blood, the number of NK cells, the number of B cells, and the like and a gene expression level measurement device 287 for measuring expression of particular genes. The first examination device 285 further includes a memory 288 storing various data, a communication control unit 289 in a wireless or wired communication with the server apparatus 201 serving as the superordinate computer, and a CPU 290 controlling the whole first examination device 285, stores in the memory 288 the measured somatic cell count and the presence or absence or amount of expression of particular genes in association with the donor ID, and transmits the information to the server apparatus 201 serving as the superordinate computer 170. According to another embodiment, the first examination device 285 may include an HLA typing device, a genomic information examination device for examining genomic information, and the like. As illustrated in 29, the server apparatus 201 serving as the superordinate computer 170 further includes a multiple regression analysis unit 204 that stores in a memory unit 202 correlation data between various data accumulated in the past and reprogramming rate and performs multiple regression analysis based on the correlation data, and a determination unit 205 that determines a predicted reprogramming rate for the somatic cell donor. According to another embodiment, the first examination device 285 may include the multiple regression analysis unit 204 and a predicted reprogramming rate determination unit 205, and transmit to the server apparatus 201 the predicted reprogramming rate, which is an indicator as to whether or not the somatic cells can be easily reprogrammed. According to another embodiment, the server apparatus 201 may include a machine learning unit that learns data features and patterns based on multiple kinds of combinations of various data accumulated in the past and reprogramming rate and a predicted reprogramming rates determination unit that determines a predicted reprogramming rate based on the learned data features and patterns. According to still another embodiment, the server apparatus 201 may include a neural network production unit that produces a neural network based on multiple kinds of combinations of various data accumulated in the past and reprogramming rates and a predicted reprogramming rate determination unit that determines a predicted reprogramming rate based on the produced neural network. Furthermore, it should be recognized that deep learning and AI may be utilized for the determination of a predicted reprogramming rate. As illustrated in 30, the server apparatus 201 stores examination information from the first examination device i. e. , the somatic cell count, the presence or absence or amount of particular genes. According to another embodiment, HLA types, genomic information, SNPs, and the like may be included in the memory unit 202, in association with at least the donor ID step S240. The server apparatus 201 then determines a predicted reprogramming rate based on the age, anamnesis, family members from whom stem cells were produced in the past, of the donor, somatic cell count, and the presence or absence and amount of particular genes stored in memory and, when the predicted reprogramming rate is out of the normal range , less than 50% step S241, the server apparatus 201 determines to output an alarm for an abnormality at the time of examination and modify the schedule step S242 and transmits the alarm for an abnormality at the time of examination and the examination information to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location step S243. 31 to 33 are flow charts illustrating operations of the stem cell information management system 200 in the manufacturing process. The stem cell information management system 200 further includes a conveyer device 140 see 1 that conveys at least one of a somatic cell collection vial 102, a stem cell freezing vial 103 empty vial, a stem cell production material vial 104, and a culture reagent vial 105 to the production device 101, based on the production device ID read from the vial, and a server apparatus 201 that stores in memory the stock information of the stem cell production material vial 104 and the culture reagent vial 105. As illustrated in 31, when the server apparatus 201 has determined that the production period of the production device 101 determined at the time of receiving the request step S250 is about to commence, the conveyer device 140 determines whether or not there is a somatic cell collection vial 102 step S251, and when there is a somatic cell collection vial 102, the server apparatus 201 determines, based on the stock information of the stem cell production material and the culture reagent, stored in memory step S252, to cause the conveyer device 140 to convey at least one of a stem cell production material vial 104 and a culture reagent vial 105. The conveyer device 140 conveys a somatic cell collection vial 102, a stem cell freezing vial 103 empty vial, a stem cell production material vial 104, and a culture reagent vial 105 to the production device 101, based on the production device ID step S253. When there is no somatic cell collection vial 102, or there is no inventory of at least one of stem cell freezing vials 103 empty vial, stem cell production material vials 104, and culture reagent vials 105, the server apparatus 201 determines to output an alarm for an abnormality at the time of production and modify the schedule step S254 and transmits the alarm for an abnormality at the time of production to the mobile terminal step S255. As illustrated in 32, the stem cell information management system 200 further includes a vision sensor for acquiring data in the production device 101 , the vision sensor 137 of the drive device 130 illustrated in 6, and the server apparatus 201 stores data from the vision sensor 137 in the memory unit 202 step S260. The server apparatus 201 determines, based on the data from the vision sensor 137 stored in the memory, whether or not the size or growth speed of the stem cell clusters is within the normal range step S261, whether or not the stem cell count is within the normal range step S262, whether or not the shape of the stem cells is within the normal range step S263, whether or not the color tone or pH of the culture reagent is within the normal range step S264, and whether or not differentiated cells having differentiated from the stem cells are present step S265. When any one of these pieces of production information is out of the normal range, the server apparatus 201 determines to output an alarm for an abnormality at the time of production and modify the schedule including modifying the predicted release date and time step S266, and transmits the alarm for an abnormality at the time of production and the production information to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location step S267. As illustrated in 33, when the server apparatus 201 has determined that it is ten minutes before the predicted release date and time of the stem cell freezing vial 102 determined at the time of receiving the request step S270, the server apparatus 201 causes the conveyer device 142 to start detecting a release of a stem cell freezing vial 103 with the vision sensor 145 step S271. When the conveyer device 142 detects a release of a stem cell freezing vial 103 step S272, the conveyer device 142 conveys the stem cell freezing vial 103 to the cryopreservation device 120 step S273. When the conveyer device 142 does not detect a release of a stem cell freezing vial 103 at the predicted release date and time step S274, the conveyer device 142 repeats the detection until ten minutes elapse from the predicted release date and time, and when ten minutes have elapsed, the server apparatus 201 outputs an alarm for an abnormality at the time of production and modifies the schedule step S275 and transmits the alarm for an abnormality at the time of production and the production information to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location step S276. 34 to 37 illustrate a configuration and an operation of the stem cell information management system 200 in the examination process of stem cells. As illustrated in 34, the stem cell information management system 200 further includes at least one of a second examination device 291 that includes a genomic information examination device 279 for somatic cells and stem cells, and a third examination device 295 that includes an HLA typing device 280 examining HLA types of somatic cells and stem cells. The second examination device 291 or the third examination device 295 further includes a memory 292, 296 storing various data, a communication control unit 293, 297 in a wireless or wired communication with the server apparatus 201 serving as the superordinate computer, and a CPU 294, 298 controlling the whole second examination device 291 or the whole third examination device 295, and stores in a memory 292, 296 the genomic information measured of the somatic cells and the stem cells or the HLA types measured of the somatic cells and the stem cells in association with the donor ID read from the vial, and transmits the genomic information or the HLA types to the server apparatus 201 serving as the superordinate computer 170. According to another embodiment, the stem cell information management system 200 may include both of the second examination device 291 and the third examination device 295. According to still another embodiment, the stem cell information management system 200 may include a fourth examination device that examines SNPs or genome sequences of somatic cells and stem cells. As illustrated in 35 and 36, the server apparatus 201 serving as the superordinate computer 170 further includes an identity determination unit 206 that determines whether or not the genomic information of the somatic cells is identical to that of the stem cells, or whether or not the HLA types of the somatic cells are identical to those of the stem cells. According to another embodiment, the second examination device 291 or the third examination device 295, not the server apparatus 201, may include the identity determination unit 206. According to still another embodiment, the server apparatus 201 may include an identity determination unit that determines whether or not the SNPs or genome sequences are identical. As illustrated in 37, the server apparatus 201 stores the examination information from the second examination device 291 or the third examination device 295 i. e. , genomic information or HLA types of the somatic cells and the stem cells in the memory unit 202 in association with the donor ID read from the vial step S280. When the genomic information or the HLA types are not identical between the somatic cells and the stem cells step S281, the server apparatus 201 determines to output an alarm for an abnormality at the time of examination and to modify the schedule step S282, and transmits the alarm for an abnormality at the time of examination and the examination information to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location step S283. 38 is a block diagram of an application of the FIELD system to the stem cell information management system 200 according to the present embodiment. The stem cell manufacturing system 200 further includes a control device 284 including interface software 282 and work software 283, and input devices connected by wired or wireless communication with the control device 284 and inputting information in respective processes. The input devices may be, for example, the transport container 250, the first examination device 285, and the drive device 130. According to another embodiment, the input devices may be, for example, input devices configured to input information in respective processes manually. The control device 284, for example, receives a first electric current value of the forward scattered light and a second electric current value of the back-scattered light and the like of the first to the third cell sorters from moment to moment from the first examination device 285, receives temperature data from the temperature estimation unit, impedance from the somatic cell coagulation monitoring device, data from the vision sensor, and the like from moment to moment from one or more transport containers 250, and receives electric current values of the first to the fourth pumps, voltage values of the first to the third switches, data from the vision sensor, and the like from moment to moment from one or more drive devices 130. Since a large number of input devices of many kinds send out pieces of information unique to a large number of components of many kinds, it is not possible to recognize, for example, which cell sorter of which examination device is measuring cell count, cell sizes, cell strain, and the like. To address this, the interface software converts the information formatted in data formats unique to the input devices into information formatted in a data format unique to the work software. The data format unique to the work software is formed with data models having a data structure of tree type or network type indicating subordination relationship of the components of each input device, and the various data models are stored in a memory of the control device 284 in advance. To facilitate understanding, for example, a first electric current value and a second electric current value of the examination device 285, a piece of information unique to the input device, is converted to examination device ID/third cell sorter/first electric current value/cell count/cell size, which is in a structured data format unique to the work software. This conversion gives the work software an instant access to data of a large number of components of many kinds in a large number of input devices of many kinds. According to the above-described stem cell information management system 200, taking into consideration the production schedules of a plurality of closed production devices 101 at the time of receiving a manufacturing request, a schedule is determined according to the shortest route and the shortest time, which shortens the production time and provides a sophisticated quality control. At the time of receiving a request, the somatic cell collection vial 102 and the stem cell freezing vial 103 of the closed container are equipped with an individual identification device 106 containing the donor ID as well as at least one of the entry ID, the transport ID, the acceptance ID, the manufacturer ID, the production device ID, the cryopreservation device ID, and the stock site ID, which prevents cross contamination and ensures traceability in case of an abnormality. Furthermore, applying the FIELD system allows determination to output an abnormality alarm and modify the schedule at the time of transport, examination, manufacturing, and stock, based on big data from a large number of components of many kinds in a large number of input devices of many kinds, which shortens the production time, provides a sophisticated quality control, and solves human resource shortages. 3. Cell Transport Apparatus 39 and 40 are perspective views of a somatic cell transport container 301 and a stem cell transport container 302 for the cell transport apparatus 300 according to the present embodiment. As illustrated in 39, the somatic cell transport container 301 is configured to contain one or more somatic cell collection vials 102 equipped with an individual identification device 106, which at least contain a donor ID, a production device ID, and the like.

According to another embodiment, the stem cell transport container 302 may be a cryopreservation device 120 illustrated in 5. Although a system in which iPS cells are produced from blood cells will be described according to the present embodiment, it should be understood that the invention can be applied to a system in which iPS cells are produced from skin-derived cells, a system in which ES cells are produced from embryonic cells, and other systems. As illustrated in 2 and 14, the cell transport apparatus 300 further includes a reader device 107 configured to read the donor ID, the production device ID, the stock site ID, and the like contained in the individual identification device 106, and a transport means for transporting the somatic cell transport container 301 to the closed production device 101, based on the read production device ID, or transporting the stem cell transport container 302 to the stem cell stock site, based on the read stock site ID, and the transport means includes at least one of automobile, railway, aircraft, ship, and robot. According to this configuration of the cell transport apparatus 300, cross contamination is prevented even when stem cells are manufactured concurrently in one or more closed production device 101. As illustrated in 23 and 24, the somatic cell transport container 301 further includes a heat retaining means for keeping the temperature inside the transport container constant, and the heat retaining means is a heating and cooling device 253 that includes a temperature estimation unit 259 estimating the temperature of the somatic cells in the transport container, and a heating and cooling unit 260 automatically performing heating or cooling in conjunction with the temperature data outputted by the temperature estimation unit 259 so that the temperature may be kept constant. The heating and cooling device 253 stores in memory an upper temperature limit and a lower temperature limit and, when the temperature data from the temperature estimation unit 259 is equal to or higher than the upper temperature limit or equal to or lower than the lower temperature limit, outputs a temperature-related abnormality alarm. According to another embodiment, the stem cell transport container 302 may include such a heating and cooling configuration. 41 is a block diagram of the stem cell transport container 302 according to the present embodiment. As illustrated in 40 and 41, the stem cell transport container 302 includes a heat retaining means for keeping the temperature inside the transport container constant, and the heat retaining means includes a refrigerant 303 for cooling or freezing the stem cells in the transport container, a refrigerant remaining amount sensor 129 configured to detect the remaining amount of the refrigerant, a reserve tank 305 detachably connected with the transport container and containing reserve refrigerant, and a reserve refrigerant supply device 306 supplying reserve refrigerant, based on the remaining amount of the refrigerant. The stem cell transport container 302 further includes a memory 307 storing various data, a CPU 308 controlling the whole stem cell transport container, and a communication control unit 309 in a wireless communication with a superordinate computer. According to another embodiment, the somatic cell transport container 301 may include such a configuration for supplying reserve refrigerant. As illustrated in 41, the stem cell transport container 302 further includes a reserve refrigerant remaining amount sensor 310 configured to detect the remaining amount of the reserve refrigerant, and a memory 307 configured to store an upper remaining amount limit and a lower remaining amount limit of the reserve refrigerant and, when the remaining amount of the reserve refrigerant is equal to or more than the upper remaining amount limit or equal to or less than the lower remaining amount limit, outputs a remaining-amount-related abnormality alarm. According to another embodiment, the somatic cell transport container 301 may outputs the remaining-amount-related abnormality alarm. As illustrated in 24, the somatic cell transport container 301 and the stem cell transport container 302 may include an accumulated time measurement device 254 measuring accumulated transportation time, and the accumulated time measurement device 254 starts to measure the accumulated transportation time from the collection date and time of the somatic cells or the release date and time of the stem cell freezing vial from the closed production device. The accumulated time measurement device 254 stores in memory a time period during which the quality of the somatic cells or the stem cells can be maintained and outputs a time-related abnormality alarm when the accumulated transportation time exceeds the time period during which the quality can be maintained. 42 is a flow chart illustrating an operation of a cell transport apparatus 300 according to the present embodiment. When at least one of the data from the temperature estimation unit step S300, the remaining amount of the reserve refrigerant step S301, the accumulated transportation time step S302, and the vibration value step S303 is out of the normal range or within the abnormal range, the transport containers 301, 302 output a corresponding alarm among the temperature-related abnormality alarm step S304, the remaining-amount-related abnormality alarm step S305 the time-related abnormality alarm step S306 and the vibration-related abnormality alarm step S307, and transmit the alarm to the mobile terminal 180 in a remote location by wireless communication. 43 is a functional block diagram of an application of the FIELD system to the cell transport apparatus 300 according to the present embodiment. The cell transport apparatus 300 further includes a control device 320 including interface software 321 and work software 322, and input devices connected by wired or wireless communication with the control device 322 and inputting information in the transport process. The input devices may be, for example, the above-described somatic cell transport container 301 and the stem cell transport container 302. According to another embodiment, the input devices may be input devices inputting information in the transport process. The control device 320, for example, receives resistance values of the temperature sensor, temperature data from the temperature estimation unit, impedance of the somatic cell coagulation monitoring device, voltage values of the refrigerant remaining amount sensor, voltage values of the reserve refrigerant remaining amount sensor, data from the vision sensor, and the like from moment to moment from one or more transport containers 301, 302. Since a large number of input devices send out pieces of information unique to a large number of components of many kinds, it is not possible to easily recognize, for example, which vial of which transport container an impedance relates to. To address this, the interface software converts the information formatted in data formats unique to the input devices into information formatted in a data format unique to the work software. The data format unique to the work software is formed with data models having a data structure of tree type or network type indicating subordination relationship of the components of each input device, and the various data models are stored in a memory of the control device 320 in advance. To facilitate understanding, for example, an impedance of the somatic cell coagulation monitoring device of a transport container, a piece of information unique to the input device, is converted to transport container ID/somatic cell coagulation monitoring device/fourth somatic cell collection vial/impedance/somatic cell coagulation value, which is in a structured data format unique to the work software. This conversion gives the work software an instant access to data of a large number of components of many kinds in a large number of input devices. According to the above-described cell transport apparatus 300, since the somatic cell collection vial 102 contains the donor ID and the production device ID, or the stem cell freezing vial 103 contains the donor ID, the production device ID, and the stock site ID, cross contamination is prevented and traceability in case of abnormality is ensured. Furthermore, applying the FIELD system allows an abnormality alarm to be outputted and transmitted instantly, based on information unique to a large number of components of many kinds in a large number of input devices, which provides a sophisticated quality control, shortens the production time, and solves human resource shortages. 4.

The conveyer device not illustrated is configured with a robot autonomously performing work according to a teaching program. As illustrated in 44 and 45, the stem cell frozen storage apparatus 400 further includes a control device 406 monitoring and controlling operational status of one or more cryopreservation devices 120, based on information from at least one of the remaining amount sensor of the cryopreservation devices 120, the temperature sensor, and the vision sensor, and the control device 406 stores the operational status of the cryopreservation devices 120 in the memory 407 in association with time information and the donor ID and the like as record information. Further, the control device 406 stores in the memory 407 at least one of a normal range and an abnormal range of the operational status and, when the operational status is at least one of being out of the normal range and being within the abnormal range, outputs an abnormality alarm at least in association with the donor ID and transmits an abnormal alarm to a superordinate computer 170 or a mobile terminal 180 in a remote location by wired or wireless communication. 46 is a functional block diagram of an application of the FIELD system to the stem cell frozen storage apparatus 400. The control device 406 includes interface software 410, work software 411, and input devices connected by wired or wireless communication with the control device 406 and inputting information in the stock process. The input devices may be, for example, many cryopreservation devices 120. According to another embodiment, the input devices may be input devices configured to input information in the stock process. The control device 406, for example, receives resistance values of the temperature sensor, voltage values of the remaining amount sensor, data form the vision sensor, voltage values of the supply valve 412, and the like from moment to moment from one or more cryopreservation devices 120. Since a large number of input devices send out pieces of information unique to a large number of components of many of kinds, it is not possible to easily recognize, for example, to which component of which cryopreservation device 120 a certain voltage relates and what it indicates. To address this, the interface software converts the information formatted in data formats unique to the input devices into information formatted in a data format unique to the work software. The data format unique to the work software is formed with data models having a data structure of tree type or network type indicating subordination relationship of the components of each input device, and the various data models are stored in a memory of the control device 407 in advance. To facilitate understanding, for example, data from the vision sensor of a cryopreservation device 120, a piece of information unique to the input device, is converted to cryopreservation device ID/vision sensor/data/presence or absence of stem cells presence or absence of frozen liquid, which is in a structured data format unique to the work software.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "A fuel cell is a type of power generation device for electrochemically reacting chemical energy of fuel in a stack to convert it into electrical energy, can be used to supply not only the driving power of industrial, household, and vehicles but also to supply power of small electronic products such as portable devices, and recently, its scope of use is gradually expanding as to clean energy source of high efficiency. A unit cell of a fuel cell has a Membrane Electrode Assembly MEA disposed at an innermost part thereof, and the membrane electrode assembly is composed of a polymer electrolyte membrane capable of transferring a hydrogen proton, and a catalyst layer, that is, a cathode and an anode applied on both surfaces of the polymer electrolyte membrane so that hydrogen and oxygen can react with each other. In addition, a pair of separators for supplying a reactant gas and discharging water generated by the reaction is disposed on one surface and the other surface of the membrane electrode assembly, that is, on the outer portion where the cathode and the anode are disposed. At this time, a Gas Diffusion Layer GDL for diffusing or smoothing the flow of the reactant gas and the generated water can be interposed between the membrane electrode assembly and the separator. Meanwhile, a Membrane-Electrode-Gasket Assembly MEGA for integrating the membrane electrode assembly and a gasket has been conventionally manufactured and used for maintaining airtightness of the unit cell and convenience in a stacking process as well. In addition, an integrated frame for integrating an insert having the gas diffusion layer bonded to the membrane electrode assembly and the gasket has also been proposed. However, the conventional integrated frame typically has bonded a frame and an insert of a plastic material by using an adhesive agent. In addition, when manufacturing the unit cell by using the conventional integrated frame, an adhesive member and a sealing member have been separately required for adhering the separator and the integrated frame. This process may result in an increase in the material cost and the manufacturing cost. In addition, conventionally, a pair of separators facing each other has been bonded in advance and then used in a stacking process in order to align the separators facing each other in the unit cells adjacent to each other when stacking the unit cell. At this time, a manifold part where the reactant gas and the coolant flow into and flow out is formed on the pair of separators stacked. There has been a problem that since the manifold part of the separator made of a metal material is a structure that directly contacts the reactant gas and the generated water, the manifold part of the metal material becomes corroded when the fuel cell is driven for a long time. In addition, there has been a problem in that since the metal separator composed of the thin plate is used in order to reduce the volume of the fuel cell, the outer manifold part of the separator of the thin plate is liable to be deformed due to an external impact and is very difficult to handle. The foregoing explained as the background is intended merely to aid in the understanding of the background of the present disclosure, and is not intended to mean that the present disclosure falls within the purview of the related art that is already known to those skilled in the art.",

Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present disclosure is not limited to the embodiments disclosed below but can be implemented in various forms differently from each other and rather, these embodiments are provided so that the present disclosure will be thorough and complete and to completely convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. The same reference numerals refer to the same elements in the drawings. 1 is an exploded perspective diagram showing an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure, and 2A and 2B are diagrams showing a cross section taken along the line A-A in 1. As shown in 1, , an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure includes an insert 100 to which a membrane electrode assembly 110 and a pair of gas diffusion layers 120 disposed on both surfaces of the insert 100 has been bonded; a separator assembly 300 disposed on one of the surfaces of the insert 100 with a pair of separators 310, 320 facing each other; and an elastomeric frame 200 integrally formed in an outside region of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 by thermal bonding. Here, the thermal bonding may be one of hot-press bonding ultrasonic bonding, high frequency bonding, vibration bonding, infrared bonding, radiant-heat bonding, calender bonding and laser bonding. In particular, the thermal bonding is preferably a hot-press bonding in which heat and pressure are easily provided. The insert 100 is a bonding body obtained by stacking the membrane electrode assembly 110 and the pair of gas diffusion layers 120, and preferably, the gas diffusion layer 120 is disposed and stacked on one surface and the other surface of the membrane electrode assembly 110, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly 110 is implemented by a polymer electrolyte membrane capable of transferring a hydrogen proton, and a general membrane electrode assembly composed of a catalyst layer, that is, a cathode and an anode applied on both surfaces of the polymer electrolyte membrane so that hydrogen and oxygen can react with each other. The gas diffusion layer 120, configured to pass through by diffusing the reactant gas flowing through the separator not shown into the membrane electrode assembly 110, is made of a base material alone or the base material and a micro-porous layer MPL formed on one surface of the base material. At this time, the base material and the material of the micro-porous layer are implemented by a material applied to a general gas diffusion layer. The separator assembly 300 is composed of the first separator 310 and the second separator 320 facing each other. At this time, the passage through which the reactant gas and the generated water flow is formed in various forms in the first separator 310 and the second separator 320. For example, the passage can be formed by forming a land and a channel by bending a region corresponding to a region where the membrane electrode assembly 110 is disposed. In addition, a diffusing part, which is diffused while the reactant gas and the generated water flow into the passage, and collected while being discharged from the passage. Meanwhile, the first separator 310 and the second separator 320 constituting the separator assembly 300 are not a pair of separators constituting the unit cells but refer to a pair of separators adjacent to each other in the adjacent unit cells. For example, a cathode separator disposed at the cathode side of the membrane electrode assembly 110 constituting any one of unit cells can be defined as the first separator 310, and an anode separator disposed at the anode side of the membrane electrode assembly 110 constituting another unit cell adjacent to the corresponding unit cell can be defined as the second separator 320. At this time, the first separator 310 and the second separator 320 facing each other in the unit cells adjacent to each other are welded at a predetermined position in a state facing each other to form the separator assembly 300. The elastomeric frame 200 is integrally formed on the outside region of the insert 100 for maintaining airtightness of the insert 100 and for convenience in the stacking process, and the elastomeric frame 200 is formed of a thermoplastic elastomer TPE for bonding by thermal bonding without a separate adhesive member while maintaining a predetermined shape. That is, the elastomeric frame 200 is disposed to surround a rim of the insert 100 and a side surface thereof and a rim of the separator assembly 300 and a side surface thereof in outer surfaces of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300, and is integrally formed with the rim of the insert 100 and the rim of the separator assembly 300 and the side surface thereof. Herein, the term outside region of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 refers to a region including edge regions of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 and space adjacent thereto, and the rim of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 refers to the edge regions of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300. In addition, for convenience of explanation, the elastomeric frame 200 is disposed to surround any one surface of both surfaces of the rim of the insert 100 and the side surface thereof and any one surface of both surfaces of the rim of the separator assembly 300 and the side surface thereof, such that the rim of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 will be referred to as a lower surface in the following description. The rim of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 is not limited to the lower surface described below and can be the opposite surface thereof, that is, the upper surface. In addition, any one surface of both surfaces of the rim of the separator assembly 300 refers to any one surface of the pair of separators constituting the separator assembly 300. Therefore, as shown in 2, in the separator assembly 300 composed of the first separator 310 and the second separator 320, any one surface of both surfaces of the rim of the separator assembly 300 will be described by being referred to as a lower surface of the first separator. For example, as shown in 2A and 2B, the elastomeric frame 200 is disposed to surround the outside regions of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 while facing the lower surface and side surface of the rim of the insert 100 and the lower surface and side surface of the rim of the separator assembly 300. In particular, the elastomeric frame 200 can extend the interface between the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 for airtight adhesion with the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300. For example, the elastomeric frame 200 is formed with a reaction surface through-hole 201 in which the insert 100 is disposed, and the inner circumferential surface of the reaction surface through-hole 201 is formed with a first step 230 for surrounding the lower surface and the side surface of the insert 100. Then, a second step 240 for surrounding the lower surface and the side surface of the separator assembly 300 is formed on the inner circumferential surface of the first step 230 formed on the elastomeric frame 200. Therefore, a fusion portion is formed at the interface between the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 and the elastomeric frame 200 by the thermal bonding, respectively, thereby implementing the firm bonding and the integration therebetween. That is, as shown in 2A and 2B, a first fusion part H1 thermally bonded while facing the first step 230 of the elastomeric frame 200 and the lower surface of the insert 100 is formed between the insert 100 and the elastomeric frame 200, and a second fusion part H2 thermally bonded while facing the second step 240 of the elastomeric frame 200 and the lower surface of the separator assembly 300 is formed between the separator assembly 300 and the elastomeric frame 200. Then, a third fusion part H3 thermally bonded while facing the first step 230 of the elastomeric frame 200 and the side surface of the insert 100 is formed between the insert 100 and the elastomeric frame 200, and a fourth fusion part H4 thermally bonded while facing the second step 240 of the elastomeric frame 200 and the side surface of the separator assembly 300 is formed between the separator assembly 300 and the elastomeric frame 200. However, since the membrane electrode assembly 110 and the gas diffusion layer 120 forming the insert 100 are formed of different materials, there is a difference in bonding performance with the elastomeric frame 200. In the present embodiment, since the thermoplastic elastomer TPE forming the elastomeric frame 200 has better bonding properties with the membrane electrode assembly 110 than the gas diffusion layer 120, any one of the pair of gas diffusion layers 120 constituting the insert 100 corresponds to the size of the inner circumferential surface thereof, and the other one of the pair of gas diffusion layers 120 constituting the insert 100 and the membrane electrode assembly 110 is formed at the size corresponding to the size of the inner circumferential surface of the second step 240. Therefore, it is preferable that when the insert 100 is bonded to the first step 230, the first fusion part H1 thermally bonded while facing the first step 230 of the elastomeric frame 200 and the lower surface of the membrane electrode assembly 110 of the insert 100 is formed, and the third fusion part H3 thermally bonded while facing the first step 230 of the elastomeric frame 200 and the membrane electrode assembly 110 of the insert 100 and the side surfaces of the pair of gas diffusion layers 120 is formed. Meanwhile, the elastomeric frame 200 is formed with an inflow manifold through-hole 210 and an outflow manifold through-hole 220 for forming a manifold for flowing the reactant gas and the coolant into and from the reaction surface formed by the insert 100. For example, a plurality of inflow manifold through-holes 210 into which the reactant gas and the coolant flow are formed at one side of the elastomeric frame 200, and a plurality of outflow manifold through-holes 220 out which the reactant gas and the coolant flow are formed on the other side thereof. Therefore, the first step 230 and the second step 240 are formed between the plurality of inflow manifold through-holes 210 and the plurality of outflow manifold through-holes 220. Then, as shown in 1 and 3, an inflow connection passage 211 for communicating the respective inflow manifold through-holes 210 with the reaction surface through-holes 201 is formed on the upper surface of the elastomeric frame 200, and an outflow connection passage 221 for communicating the respective outflow manifold through-holes 220 with the reaction surface through-holes 201 are formed. At this time, it is preferable that the depths of the inflow connection passage 211 and the outflow connection passage 221 are formed at a level that can communicate with the region where the second step 240 has been formed. For example, in the present embodiment, the depths of the inflow connection passage 211 and the outflow connection passage 221 were formed at the depth corresponding to the height of the upper surface of the second step 240. Meanwhile, a method for manufacturing the elastomeric cell frame for the fuel cell configured as described above will be described. The method for manufacturing an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes preparing the insert 100 by bonding the gas diffusion layer 120 to both surfaces of the membrane electrode assembly 110, respectively; preparing the separator assembly 300 while facing and bonding the pair of separators 310, 320; disposing on the upper portion of the elastomeric frame 200 so that the rims of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 are overlapped with each other; and bonding that integrally forms by thermal bonding therebetween by pressing while applying heat to the overlapped portion between the elastomeric frame 200, the insert 100, and the separator assembly 300. The preparing the insert is preparing the insert 100 by bonding the membrane electrode assembly 110 and the gas diffusion layer 120. At this time, the membrane electrode assembly 110 prepares a polymer electrolyte membrane, and a general membrane electrode assembly in which a cathode and an anode are formed on both surfaces of the polymer electrolyte membrane. In addition, the gas diffusion layer 120 also prepares a general gas diffusion layer made of the base material alone or the base material and a micro-porous layer MPL formed on one surface of the base material. Then, the insert 100 is prepared by stacking the gas diffusion layer 120 on both surfaces of the membrane electrode assembly 110. However, as described above, in order to enhance the bonding performance between the insert 100 and the elastomeric frame 200, any one of the pair of gas diffusion layers 120 can be formed to have the size smaller than those of the membrane electrode assembly 110 and the other one of gas diffusion layers 120 so that the exposed region is thermally bonded to the first step 230 of the elastomeric frame 200 while the lower surface of the membrane electrode assembly 110 is exposed in the bonding described later. The preparing the separator assembly is integrating the first separator 310 and the second separator 320. Firstly, the separator assembly 300 is prepared by molding the first separator 310 and the second separator 320 made of a metal material, respectively, and then welding the first separator 310 and the second separator 320 at a predetermined position in a state facing each other. At this time, the manifold region is not formed in the first separator 310 and the second separator 320, and only the passage through which the reactant gas and the coolant flow is formed thereon. The preparing the elastomeric frame is preparing the sheet-shaped elastomeric frame 200 disposed to surround the insert 100 and the outside region of the separator assembly 300. Meanwhile, at the time of molding the elastomeric frame 200, the reaction surface through-hole 201 in which the insert 100 is disposed; the plurality of inflow manifold through-holes 210 into which the reactant gas and the coolant flow; the plurality of outflow manifold through-holes 220 out which the reactant gas and the coolant flow; the first step 230 for surrounding the lower surface and the side surface of the insert 100 on the inner circumferential surface of the reaction surface through-hole 201; and the second step 240 for surrounding the lower surface and the side surface of the separator assembly 300 in the outside region of the first step 230 are formed. The disposing is disposed so that the rims of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 are overlapped with the elastomeric frame 200. For example, the rim of the insert 100 is disposed to be seated on the first step 230, and the separator assembly 300 is disposed to be seated on the second step 240. Preferably, the lower surface of the rim of the insert 100 is seated on the first step 230 of the elastomeric frame 200 so that the side surface of the rim of the insert 100 faces the inner circumferential surface of the reaction surface through-hole 201 of the elastomeric frame 200 and the outer circumferential surface of the first step 230. Then, the lower surface of the rim of the separator assembly 300 is seated on the second step 240 of the elastomeric frame 200 so that the side surface of the rim of the separator assembly 300 faces the outer circumferential surface of the second step 240 of the elastomeric frame 200. The bonding is bonding the elastomeric frame 200, the insert 100, and the separator assembly 300 to each other by the thermal bonding of the elastomeric frame 200. Here, the thermal bonding may be one of hot-press bonding ultrasonic bonding, high frequency bonding, vibration bonding, infrared bonding, radiant-heat bonding, calender bonding and laser bonding. In particular, the thermal bonding is preferably a hot-press bonding in which heat and pressure are easily provided. For this purpose, the elastomeric frame 200 and the insert 100 are seated in the hot-press mold. Then, the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 are bonded while the elastomeric frame 200 is melted at a predetermined position by applying heat to some or all of the region corresponding to the outside regions of the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300 by operating the hot-press mold. Therefore, the elastomericic frame 200, the insert 100, and the separator assembly 300 are bonded while the elastomeric frame 200 is thermally bonded at the interface thereof even without a separate adhesive member. At this time, the heat applied to the elastomeric frame 200 is preferably higher than the melting temperature of the elastomeric frame 200 in order to firmly bond the elastomeric frame 200 and the insert 100 and the separator assembly 300. Meanwhile, the shapes of the elastomeric frame 200 and the separator assembly 300 can be changed in order to enhance the bonding performance between the elastomeric frame 200 and the separator assembly 300 and the bonding performance between the stacked elastomeric frames 200. 4A and 4B are diagrams showing an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in 4A and 4B, in an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a second embodiment, at least one sealing protrusion 261 for surrounding the separator assembly 300 is disposed on one surface of both surfaces of the elastomeric frame 200 along the periphery of the region where the separator assembly 300. Then, at least one sealing groove 262 for surrounding the separator assembly 300 is formed on the other surface of both surfaces of the elastomeric frame 200 along the periphery of the region where the separator assembly 300 is disposed. At this time, it is preferable that the sealing groove 262 is formed at a position corresponding to the position where the sealing protrusion 261 is formed, and the shape thereof is also formed in the shape corresponding to each other. Therefore, when the plurality of the elastomeric frames 200 are stacked, the sealing protrusion 261 and the sealing groove 262 of the elastomeric frame 200 adjacent to each other can face each other, thereby expecting the alignment effect before the thermal bonding, and the interface thereof in the thermal bonding is extended, thereby enhancing the bonding performance. In addition, a plurality of first assembly through-holes 311 can be formed to be spaced apart from each other in a predetermined region along the rim thereof in the first separator 310 constituting the separator assembly 300, and the second separator 320 can be formed with a plurality of second assembly through-holes 321 communicated with the first assembly through-hole 311. Then, an assembly protrusion 250 for penetrating the first assembly through-hole 311 and the second assembly through-hole 321 can be formed in the second step 240 of the elastomeric frame 200. Therefore, as in 4A, it is disposed by penetrating the first assembly through-hole 311 and the second assembly through-hole 321 of the separator assembly 300 into the assembly protrusion 250 formed in the elastomeric frame 200. In this state, as in 4B, pressure is applied while applying heat to the end portion 251 of the assembly protrusion 250 by using the hot-press mold HM1, and the end portion 251 of the assembly protrusion 250 is bonded to the surface of the separator assembly 300 while being enlarged in the flange shape. Although 4A and 4B have shown an embodiment in which all of the sealing protrusion 261, the sealing groove 262, and the assembly protrusion 250 are formed, only the sealing protrusion 261 and the sealing groove 262 can be formed, or only the assembly protrusion 250 can be formed. 5 is a diagram showing an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a third embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in 5, in the elastomeric cell frame for the fuel cell according to a third embodiment, the first separator 310 constituting the separator assembly 300 is formed with a first uneven protrusion 312 laterally extended from the side surface thereof, and the second separator 320 is formed with a second uneven protrusion laterally extended from the side surface thereof in a shape corresponding to the first uneven protrusion 312. Then, the outer circumferential surface of the second step 240 formed on the elastomeric frame 200 is formed with an uneven groove part 241 formed horizontally with the surface of the elastomeric frame 200 and coupled with the first uneven protrusion 312 and a second uneven protrusion 322Therefore, when the separator assembly 300 is disposed on the second step 240 of the elastomeric frame 200 to be fused, it is possible to enhance the degree of assembly alignment by the shapes corresponding to each other, and to enhance the bonding performance by expanding the interface therebetween. 6A and 6B are diagrams showing an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a fourth embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in 6A and 6B, in an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a fourth embodiment, a cover part 271 extended to cover the rim of the separator assembly 300 is formed on the upper surface of the elastomeric frame 200. Then, a cover groove 272 is formed at a position corresponding to the position where the cover part 271 has been formed in the shape corresponding to a position where the cover part 271 has been formed in the lower surface of the elastomeric frame 200. Therefore, when the plurality of the elastomeric frames 200 are stacked, the cover part 271 and the cover groove 272 of the elastomeric frame 200 adjacent to each other face each other, thereby expecting the alignment effect before the thermal bonding, and the interface thereof in the thermal bonding is expanded, thereby enhancing the bonding performance. Although 6A and 6B have shown an embodiment in which all of the sealing protrusion 261, the sealing groove 262, the cover part 271, and the cover groove 272 are formed, only the sealing protrusion 261 and the sealing groove 262 are formed, or only the cover part 271 and the cover groove 272 can be formed. Meanwhile, a fuel cell stack is configured by stacking the elastomeric cell frame for the fuel cell in plural. As shown in 2B, the elastomeric cell frame including the insert 100, the separator assembly 300, and the elastomeric frame 200 are stacked in plural to form a fuel cell stack, and at this time, it is preferable that the elastomeric frames 200 of the elastomeric cell frame adjacent to each other are stacked while being thermally bonded. That is, the elastomeric frames 200 of the elastomeric cell frame adjacent to each other are formed with a fifth fusion part H5 thermally bonded in the region facing each other. Therefore, the elastomeric frames 200 of the elastomeric cell frame adjacent to each other are bonded by the fifth fusion part H5. Meanwhile, it is possible to expand the region of thermal bonding in order to enhance the bonding performance between the elastomeric frames 200 adjacent to each other. 7A and 7B are diagrams showing an elastomeric cell frame for a fuel cell according to a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in 7A and 7B, firstly, a plurality of elastomeric cell frames are stacked, and the upper surface and the lower surface facing each other are bonded by the thermal bonding in the elastomeric frames 200 adjacent to each other. Therefore, the fifth fusion part H5 is formed between the upper surface and the lower surface facing each other in the elastomeric frame 200 adjacent to each other. In this state, a sixth fusion part H6 is formed in which pressure is applied while applying heat to the side portion of the elastomeric frame 200 by the hot-press mold HM2, and the side surfaces of the respective elastomeric frames 200 are integrally thermally bonded. While the present disclosure has been described with reference to the accompanying drawings and the above-described preferred embodiments, the present disclosure is not limited to thereto, and is limited by the claims described later. Therefore, those skilled in the art can deform and modify the present disclosure variously within the scope of the technical spirit of the claims described later.",

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Pre-sterilized disposable plastic cell culture containers have become ubiquitous for culturing of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. These plastic cell culture containers are usually fabricated from synthetic polymer resins including polystyrene, polyvinyl, polycarbonate, and polyolefin-type polyethylene and polypropylene thermoplastics. One major problem arising from the ubiquitous and large-scale use of plastic cell culture containers is that of environmental sustainability. Commercial sterilization of such thermoplastic products is routinely accomplished using either gamma irradiation, electron-beam irradiation, or ethylene oxide treatment. With few exceptions, plastic cell culture containers are difficult or impossible to reuse because they would require washing and re-sterilization, in which generally available laboratory sterilization equipment , steam autoclaves would melt or severely distort most of the conventionally used plastics described above that have relatively low softening and melting temperatures. Consequently, these plastic cell culture containers are usually discarded in landfills or destroyed by incineration after use. Landfill disposal is undesirable because petroleum-derived synthetic plastics do not readily decompose or compost, and incineration can produce toxic gases. Thus, there is an urgent need for cell culture containers that are environmentally degradable and suitable for landfill compost or disposal. When most types of conventional cell culture vessels are used to grow anchorage-dependent animal or plant cells also referred to as attachment-dependent or adherent cells, an interior surface of the culture vessel has to be pre-treated, modified, or coated to promote cellular attachment, without which many cell types will not grow. While an untreated polystyrene Petri dish may be useful for culturing bacteria and yeast cells on a solid nutrient agar, for example, the untreated polystyrene dish is not a useful or functional container for growing anchorage-dependent mammalian cells. Various surface treatments and coatings for promoting cellular attachment to polystyrene cell culture containers are known. Such treatments, coatings, or modifications can significantly add to the cost and complexity of producing a cell culture container. The cost can rapidly increase for large 2D growth surfaces or for complex 3D growth surfaces. Thus, there is a need for cell culture containers that do not require surface treatments, coatings, or modifications for successful cultivation of anchorage-dependent animal or plant cells, while still providing cellular attachment and robust cell anchorage.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "The present technology provides cell culture containers that can be utilized for cultivating prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, including adherent cells, such as adherent mammalian cells, without requiring surface treatment of the containers after they have been molded from thermoplastic resin. Growth surfaces of the cell culture containers of the present technology can be untreated and uncoated, or optionally can be chemically or physically treated or coated to enhance cell adhesion. The cell culture containers disclosed herein can more easily and economically have large growth surfaces and/or complex or 3D surface shapes because no treatment or coating step is necessary. Further, the cell culture containers of the present technology can be environmentally degradable and suitable for composting in landfills. A preferred thermoplastic resin for use in the present technology is a blend of poly-L-lactide resin PLLA or PLA and poly-D-lactide resin PDLA or PDA. PLA can be commercially produced from agricultural biomass materials that provide plant starch, and PLA is considered environmentally sustainable. PLA is a polymer of L-lactate monomers, and both the polymer and monomer are enzymatically degraded and consumed by a variety of microorganisms. PDA is the enantiomer of PLA. PDA is a polymer of D-lactate monomers, which are produced by certain bacteria. Polymerization of D-lactate can produce PDA in various molecular weights. Formula 1 depicts L-+-lactic acid, also known as S-lactic acid. Formula 2 depicts D--lactic acid, also known as R-lactic acid. To allow visual and microscopic monitoring of cells as they are being cultured, the cell culture containers can be fully transparent at visible wavelengths of light. Unfortunately, transparent PLA pure poly-L-lactide has a low softening temperature about 50 C. that limits its use and would be inconsistent with most cell culture applications. The addition of microparticulate minerals such as talc and other substances is known to promote PLA crystallization, resulting in higher softening and melting temperatures. However, the resulting loss of transparency makes microparticle-modified PLA generally unsuitable for cell culture containers. Methods of admixing PDA resin with PLA resin disclosed herein can provide higher softening and melting temperatures while retaining transparency suitable for cell culture applications. Annealing methods are disclosed herein which can retain the transparency of a mixture of PLA and PDA, and the mixture can simultaneously have a softening temperature greater than 50 C. A general structure of poly-lactide or polylactide is shown in Formula 3. In Formula 3, the methyl groups are each attached to a chiral center. Each chiral center can be the S-configuration or the R-configuration. When referring to a monomer of lactic acid lactide, the S-configuration is L or levorotatory. PLA contains lactides in the S-configuration. By comparison, PDA contains lactides in the R-configuration which is D or dextrorotatory. In Formula 3, the methyl groups can assume either the S or R configuration, so the general structure of poly-lactide can comprise either enantiomer of lactic acid. Depending on polymerization conditions, polymerization of either R or S lactic acid can result in polymers having different molecular weights. For example, a linear molecular formula of poly-lactide can be illustrated with HC3H4O2nOCH3, C3O2H4n, CH3C3O2H4nCH3, or with C3O3H5C3O2H4nC3O2H5. In Formula 3, for example, with each monomer unit having a molecular mass of 72 g per mole, a value of n greater than 1500 can represent a polymer with molecular weight M2 greater than 100,000 Da. The value of n selected for polymerization and resin manufacture will depend upon the polylactide product application, where an extruded film may require an n of approximately 4,000 or a M2 of 300,000 Da while an injection-molded container may require an n of approximately 1,400 or a M2 of 100,000 Da. In general, the value of n can be at least 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 1400, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 or more. Optionally coupled with any of these lower limits, as appropriate, the value of n can be less than or equal to 10000, 5000, 3000, 2000, 1500, 1200, 1000, or 500. Polymerization of a racemic mixture of L- and D-lactides can lead to the synthesis of poly-DL-lactide PDLLA polymer, which can be amorphous. Depending on the ratio of enantiomers used during polymerization, different forms of PDLLA can be obtained. PolyL-lactide-co-D,L-lactide PDLLA is a thermoplastic aliphatic polyester synthesized from both enantiomers D and L of lactic acid. PDLLA has some monomers with alternating R and S-configuration, as shown in the example monomer m of Formula 4. In monomer m in Formula 4, the leftmost methyl group is in the R or D configuration, with the next methyl group in the S or L configuration. In general, the values of m and n each can be independently at least 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 1400, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 or more. Optionally coupled with any of these lower limits, as appropriate, the value of m and n each can be independently less than or equal to 10000, 5000, 3000, 2000, 1500, 1200, 1000, or 500. Different forms of poly-lactide, for example, comprising different repeating sequences of D and L in a poly-lactide polymer can yield materials with different degrees of crystallinity, thermal transitions, solubility, and rates of degradation. The present technology can comprise different forms of poly-lactide polymer. The molecular weights of the various poly-lactide polymers can vary. The present technology can utilize poly-lactide polymers with branching at any position, with branching upon branching, or without branching straight chain polymers. As used herein, poly-L-lactide, polyL-lactide, PLA, or PLLA refers to a polymer consisting of S-lactic acid and does not refer to racemic PLLA racemic poly-L-lactic acid. As used herein, poly-D-lactide, polyD-lactide, PDA, or PDLA refers to a polymer consisting of R-lactic acid and does not refer to racemic PDLA racemic poly-D-lactic acid. Branching can be introduced during polymerization of lactic acid, and both poly-L-lactide PLA, PLLA and poly-D-lactide PDA, PDLA can refer to branched or unbranched polymers of S-lactic acid or R-lactic acid, respectively. During synthesis of PLA, some R-lactic acid can be present, so throughout this technology, the PLA can have some impurity, R-lactic acid, in the polymer. Similarly, during synthesis of PDA, some S-lactic acid can be present, so throughout this technology, the PDA can have some impurity, S-lactic acid, in the polymer. Highly pure forms of PLA and PDA are desirable, but polymerization utilizing chiral monomers can contain some chiral impurity. As used herein, a mixture of D- and L-enantiomer polymers of polylactide refers to a mixture of PLA and PDA polymers. For example, a mixture can be 95% weight/weight PLA and 5% weight/weight PDA, wherein the PLA and PDA are separate non-joined polymers. Another example of a mixed polymer is a single polymer chain containing 95% PLA and 5% PDA w/w. Yet another example is a mixture of single polymer chain wherein 95% weight of the initial polymer units are PLA and 5% weight of the final polymer units are PDA. All mixtures of PLA and PDA of the present technology can contain 0-100% PDA and 0-100% PLA, with the total of PDA+PLA=100%. As used herein 2D cell culture refers to a culture of cells grown on a flat surface. The cells can be grown as a monolayer on Petri dishes, flasks, multi-well plates, or other cell culture containers. Additional cells optionally can grow over the initial monolayer, forming additional layers. 3D cell culture refers to a culture of living cells inside or upon surfaces forming a 3D structure, such as a cell scaffold, which can mimic tissue and organ specific microarchitecture. In 3D cell culture, growth of cells in a 3D arrangement can allow better cell-to-cell contact and intercellular signaling networks. The 3D cell culture can facilitate developmental processes allowing cells to differentiate into more complex structures. 3D cell culture can be described as organotypic culture, involving the growth of cells in a three-dimensional 3-D environment. A 3D cell culture can be biochemically and physiologically more similar to in vivo tissue. In 3D cell culture, cells may be cultured and supported in three dimensions, , on and around fibers, beads, sponges, lattices, matrices, or scaffolds. The term adherent cells describes anchorage-dependent cells that are cultured on a suitable substrate that chemically and/or physically promotes cell adhesion and spreading. For culturing adherent cells and for growth of adherent cells, a cell culture container that the cells can attach to is required. Growth of adherent cells in a cell culture container typically begins with a monolayer of cells attached to or anchored to a growth surface of the cell culture container. The present technology can provide a suitable substrate for culture of adherent cells without any treatment or coating of the culture container. The majority of cells derived from vertebrates are adherent cells, with the exception of hematopoietic cell lines and certain others. Some adherent cell lines can also be adapted for suspension culture. Many commercially available insect cell lines grow well in monolayer or suspension culture. Anchorage dependence refers to the need for cells to be adhered to or in contact with a solid surface or another layer of cells. Cells can be adhered to other cells or to extracellular matrix, for example. In cell culture containers that require a coating, cells can adhere to a coating of amino acids or protein affixed to a plastic surface of a conventional culture container. The coating of amino acids or protein can contain carbonyl groups. Adherent cells can be sensitive to an anchored state through physical cytoskeletal signaling, as well as through juxtacrine or gap/tight junction mediated signaling. Typically, epithelial cells are anchorage dependent and will die if no longer adhered to other cells, a process referred to as anoikis. The term biodegradable refers to polymers that degrade fully i. e. , down to monomeric species under long-term composting or other decomposition by bacteria or other living organisms, including fungi. Biodegradable polymers are not necessarily hydrolytically degradable and may require enzymatic action to fully degrade. As used herein, a cell culture container can be a Petri dish, a culture flask, a roller bottle, a microwell or multiwell plate , 24-well, 96-well, 384-well plates, or any container suitable for cell culture. A cell culture container can have one or more 2D growth surfaces, and/or it can have 3D features for cell growth. The 3D features, for example, can be inserts, beads, lattices, micro-scaffolds, sponge-like structures, spheroids, web-like structures, and surfaces within multiple growth arenas for cell culture. The term compostable means that a compound or material is capable of disintegrating into natural elements in a compost environment, leaving little or no toxicity in the resulting compost material. At least some beginning of composting typically occurs in about 90 days or less under ideal composting conditions. A compost environment can have organic matter such as dead leaves, twigs, grass clippings, vegetable waste, fruit scraps, coffee grounds, and moisture. The process of composting can involve making a heap of wet organic matter and waiting for the materials to break down into humus after a period of months. As used herein, the term electromagnetic radiation can include radio waves, microwaves, infrared IR, visible light, ultraviolet, high energy electrons or an electron beam, X-rays, and/or gamma rays. As used herein, the term enantiomer refers to a molecule that is a mirror image of another; an enantiomeric pair is a pair of molecules that are mirror images of each other. An enantiomer can contain one or more chiral centers stereocenters. A pair of enantiomers differs only in the spatial arrangement of their atoms, resulting in enantiomers being stereoisomers. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another and are non-superimposable on one another. Stereoisomers with two or more chiral centers stereocenters can be diastereomers. As used herein, a poly-L-lactide polymer can be an enantiomer of a poly-D-lactide polymer. A poly-L-lactide polymer can be a diastereomer of a poly-D-lactide polymer if, for example, there are differences in purity of one or more chiral centers, differences in polymer chain length or branching, or differences in polymer secondary form. The polymer PDLLA is a diastereomer of poly-L-lactide and of poly-D-lactide. The heat deflection temperature or heat distortion temperature HDT, HDTUL, or DTUL is the temperature at which a polymer or plastic sample deforms under a specified load. An example of a method to measure HDT is to expose a plastic to an elevated temperature in air and to observe whether distortion of the plastic occurs. The term hydrophilic, as used herein, refers to the property of having affinity for water. Compounds having hydrophilic properties can, for example, have hydrogen bond accepting functional groups, to which water can form hydrogen bonds. Hydrophilic polymers or hydrophilic polymer segments are polymers or polymer segments which can have affinity for aqueous solutions i. e. , are generally water soluble and/or have a tendency to absorb water. In general, the more hydrophilic a polymer is, the more that polymer tends to be wetted by water. The term hydrophobic, as used herein, refers to the property of lacking affinity for, or even repelling water. For example, the more hydrophobic a polymer or polymer segment, the more that polymer or polymer segment tends to not be wetted by water. The kilogray is a derived metric SI measurement unit of absorbed radiation dose of ionizing radiation, high energy electrons, X-rays or gamma rays. One kilogray is equal to one thousand gray 1000 Gy, and the gray is defined as the absorption of one joule of ionizing radiation by one kilogram 1 J/kg of matter. The term microparticle refers to any particle having at least one dimension on the microscale. The term microscale refers to a feature or structure having at least one dimension in the range from about 1 micron to about 1000 microns. The term nanoscale refers to a feature or structure having at least one dimension in the range from about 1 nm to about 999 nm. The term polymer molecular weight can have different meanings. The term can refer to average molecular weight Mi that is the molecular weight as calculated by the weight of the molecule that is most prevalent in the mix that makes up a molecule. The term can alternatively refer to number average molecular weight Mn, which is the molecular weight determined by counting the number of tall the different-sized molecules tin a mixture of polymer molecules and determining the weight, Mn, for which half the number of molecules in the mixture are larger and half are smaller than that Mn value. Or, the term can refer to weight average molecular weight Mw, which is the molecular weight as calculated by taking all the different weight molecules in a mixture of polymer molecules and determining the weight, Mw, for which half the total weight of molecules is greater and half is less than that Mw value, The units for the molecular weight are typically Dalton Da or kilodalton KDa, plural kilodaltons. The dispersity or polydispersity index PDI is a measure of the distribution of molecular mass in a given polymer sample. The or PDI of a polymer is calculated as PDI=Mw/Mn, where Mw is the weight average molecular weight and Mn is the number average molecular weight. Mw is more sensitive to polymer molecules of high molecular weight, while Mn is more sensitive to polymer molecules of low molecular weight. The or PDI of a polymer indicates the distribution of individual molecular weights in a collection or batch of polymers. The or PDI has a value equal to or greater than 1, but as the polymers in a given batch approach the same chain length, the or PDI approaches 1. A polymer material is denoted by the term disperse, or non-uniform, if its chain lengths vary over a wide range of molecular masses. As used herein, the term transparent means allowing visible light to pass through, such that shapes and objects can be discerned or focused upon utilizing the light passing through, either without or with a light microscope, such as to discern cellular morphologies and cellular organelles. The term translucent means allowing light, but not details of shapes, to pass through. As used herein, the term untreated surface refers to a surface of a cell culture container that has not been exposed to a treatment other than sterilization, or coated to improve cell adherence upon the surface. By comparison, various treatments and coatings are known to improve cell adherence upon a surface, and the treatments include a variety of physio-chemical processes such as microwave plasma oxygen gas treatment, poly-L-lysine or poly-D-lysine coatings or protein coatings applied to polystyrene container surfaces. As used herein, the Vicat softening temperature VST is the temperature at which a standard indenter a flat-ended needle with a 1 mm2 circular or square cross-section penetrates 1 mm into the surface of a plastic test specimen under a constant load when the temperature is increased at a uniform rate. For the Vicat A test, a load of 10 N is used. For the Vicat B test, the load is 50 N. A Vicat softening temperature can be utilized to measure a softening point for materials that have no definite melting point, such as polymers, plastics, and glasses. As used herein, a plastic cell culture container without surface modification refers to a container whose surfaces substantially retain their structure, chemical properties, and physical properties as they existed after formation of the plastic container from a resin, and which have not been treated other than to a sterilization process as required for cell culture. Surface modification would include, for example, surface melting, abrasion, oxygen and/or nitrogen plasma treatment, chemical addition/modification, or coating addition, such as coating with one or more biomolecules such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, lipids, proteoglycans, or polysaccharides, or coated with a polymer not present in the body of the container. In some surface-modified cell culture containers, oxygen plasma microwave treatment adds oxygen to a polystyrene plastic surface, or protein, or polypeptide coatings including positively charged poly-L-lysine or poly-D-lysine of various molecular weights bind to a negatively charged plastic surface such as polystyrene and contain carbonyl groups or oxygen atoms that can extend from a charged plastic surface and interact with cells; such treatments or coatings are unnecessary and can be excluded in the present technology, wherein the cell culture container can be used for culturing adherent cells and non-adherent cells without substantial surface modification. The surfaces of cell culture containers of the present technology can allow mammalian cell adhesion and growth without the need for any specific surface modification. The term about as used herein, generally refers to a particular numeric value that is within an acceptable error range as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the numeric value is measured or determined, i. e. , the limitations of the measurement system. For example, about can mean a range of 20%, 10%, or 5% of a given numeric value. As used herein, the terms highly pure and high purity are defined as a material having a purity of about 95-100%, 96-100%, 97-100%, 98-100%, 99-100%, 99. 9-100%, 99. 99-100%, or 99. 999%-100%. As used herein, chirally pure means about 95-100%, 96-100%, 97-100%, 98-100%, 99-100%, 99. 9-100%, 99. 99-100%, or 99. 999%-100% of the S chiral centers in poly-L-lactide are S and of the R chiral centers in poly-D-lactide are R, respectively. As such, chiral purity can be specified as at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, at least 99%, and at least 99. 5%.

                    "DESCRIPTION": "The present technology provides cell culture containers made from blends of poly-L-lactide PLA and poly-D-lactide PDA which blends are transparent, have good temperature and mechanical stability, and are biodegradable and compostable. These cell culture containers also can provide excellent anchorage for adherent cells without any cell adhesion-promoting coating or surface treatment. PLA is a readily biodegradable polymer which has been used to produce a variety of plastic consumer articles, typically by injection molding at temperatures in the range from about 178 C. to about 240 C. PLA has a melting temperature in the range from about 157 C. to about 170 C. However, molded products made from PLA have a heat deflection temperature from about 49 C. to about 52 C. , and their Vicat softening temperature is about 50 C. This makes pure PLA unsuitable for making cell culture containers, as the containers would deform at temperatures greater than about 50 C. The present inventor has discovered that suitable cell culture containers with highly desirable properties of heat stability, transparency, biodegradability, and compatibility with adherent cells can be made by combining PLA with PDA to form a polymer blend before molding. Enantiomers generally have similar chemical properties, except when they interact with other chiral compounds or with some enzymes. Thus, the melting temperature, heat deflection temperature, and Vicat softening temperature of a sample of PDA will be the same as a sample of PLA if their polymer MW and branching are the same. Surprisingly, by mixing certain proportions of PDA with PLA, it is possible to form cell culture containers with a high tolerance for heat. The cell culture container can be transparent and can be compostable. Unexpectedly, such cell culture containers can be used with adherent cells without the need for chemical or physical treatments or applying adhesion-promoting coatings. PLA and PDA polymers for use in the present technology can be of any molecular weight useful to produce suitable cell culture containers. For example, the molecular weight can be a value specified as suitable by the resin manufacturer for manufacturing containers by injection molding, blow-molding, or thermoforming. For an injection-molding resin, a typical polylactide molecular weight can be about 100,000 Da or from about 75,000 to 125,000 Da, or from about 50,000 to 150,000 Da. for example. The polymers have any dispersity and any level of polymer branching consistent with the desired properties of suitability for manufacturing and use as a cell culture container, or desired values of Vicat softening temperature, transparency, biodegradability, and/or cell attachment. The PLA and PDA polymers utilized to form cell culture containers herein can have various substituents on various methyl groups or various carbonyl groups. For example, Formula 5 illustrates substituents R1, R2, and R3 on methyl groups in PLA, PDA, or a diastereomer of PLA or PDA. In general, the value of n can be at least 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 1400, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 or more. Optionally coupled with any of these lower limits, as appropriate, the value of n can be less than or equal to 10000, 5000, 3000, 2000, 1500, 1200, 1000, or 500. Formula 6 illustrates substituents R4, R5, and R6 on the carbonyl oxygens of PLA, PDA, or a diastereomer of PLA or PDA. In general, the value of n can be at least 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 1400, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 or more. Optionally coupled with any of these lower limits, as appropriate, the value of n can be less than or equal to 10000, 5000, 3000, 2000, 1500, 1200, 1000, or 500. The substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 R1-R6 in Formulas 5 and 6 can be independently selected and can all be the same or different. Substituents on methyl groups, for example in Formula 5, can be present or combined with substituents on carbonyl groups, for example in Formula 6. The substituents R1, R2, and R3 R1-R3 can be present but without any substituents R4, R5, and R6 R4-R6 on carbonyls. R1-R3 can be hydrogen and R4-R6 can be no substituents. For example, R1-R3 can be hydrogen, hydroxy, sulfoxy, halo, acyl, acyloxy, alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, heteroalkynyl, alkoxy, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, arylhalo, arylhydroxy, arylcyano, aryltrifluoromethyl, aryltrifluoromethoxy, arylnitro, aryltrifluoro-methoxy, aryl ether, aryl ester, aryl sulfonyl, aryl sulfinyl, aryl sulfonamidyl, aryl sulfonate, aryl sulfoxyl, aryl phosphate ester, aryl carbonyl, aryl carboxylate, aryl carbamate, aryl amine, aryl imide, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heteroarylhalo, heteroarylhydroxy, heteroarylcyano, hetero-aryltrifluoromethyl, aryltrifluoromethoxy, arylnitro, heteroaryltrifluoromethoxy, heteroarylnitro, heteroarylether, heteroarylester, heteroarylsulfonyl, heteroarylsulfinyl, heteroarylsulfonamidyl, heteroarylsulfonate, heteroarylsulfoxyl, heteroarylphosphate ester, heteroarylcarbonyl, heteroarylcarboxylate, heteroarylcarbamate, heteroarylamine, heteroarylimide, quinidine, morpholine; any ring structure can be optionally substituted with any of the substituents described herein; and any two adjacent substituents can come together to form a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system. The substituents R4-R6 can include any the aforementioned substituents for R1-R3 that are suitable for covalent attachment to oxygen. The PLA or PDA polymers utilized in the present technology can be neutral or can have positive or negative charges on various substituents , protonated tertiary amino groups or deprotonated carboxyl groups. The PLA and PDA can have negative charge on one or more oxygen atoms as is shown in Formula 7, where associated cations A+, B+, and D+ can be the same or different. A+, B+, and D+ can have multivalent charge and can form salts with the polylactide polymer chain in hemi, mono, bis, and other configurations. The negative charge on an oxygen illustrated in Formula 7 can be a partial charge, as resonant structures are possible with a carbonyl adjacent to O, further illustrating the possibility for hemi, mono, bis, and other salt configurations. A+, B+, and D+ can be independently organic or inorganic cations, a trivalent metal cation, or a monovalent alkali earth metal cation. In Formula 7, the D+ cation can be absent and the negatively charged oxygen associated with D+ can be a carbonyl, such that A+ and B+ form salts without presence of D+. Although not illustrated in Formula 7, organic anions, for example a borate, can interact with various functional groups either covalently attached to the polylactides or to cations in ionic attachment to the polylactides. The PLA and the PDA utilized to form cell culture containers can have various, independently selected, functional groups on the terminal ends of the PLA and the PDA. Functional groups on the terminal ends are various functional groups that can be covalently attached to the terminal ends of a main polymer backbone chain of PLA or PDA and to terminal ends of branching polymer chains extending from the main polymer backbone, or from other branching polymer chains. Formula 8 represents a non-limiting example of an amine functional group attached to a terminal end of PLA. The amine functional group illustrated in Formula 8 can represent any other suitable functional group for attachment to terminal ends of PLA or PDA. Non-limiting examples of functional groups are esters, thiols, propargyl from alkyne propyne, azide, acrylate, methacrylate, or N-2-hydroxyethylmaleimide. The functional groups attached to terminal ends can form bridges between or among polymer chains. The PLA and the PDA utilized to form cell culture containers can have independently selected, joining functional groups on the terminal ends of the PLA and the PDA. Joining functional groups can attach to one or more terminal ends of PLA or PDA and join the PLA or PDA to other polymers of PLA or PDA. In this way, one or more joining functional groups can extend the polymer length of PLA or PDA. Any joining group suitable for attachment to PLA or PDA, with further attachment to PLA or PDA can be utilized. A non-limiting example is a secondary amine that is attached to a PLA polymer on both ends. For example, the primary amine illustrated in Formula 8 can be a secondary amine with PLA polymers attached on both sides of the secondary amine. Addition of compounds, salts, or chemicals to PLA can increase the Vicat softening temperature and the heat deflection temperature, but can result in a loss of transparency. For example, the addition of talc to PLA can be utilized to produce opaque cutlery and dishware that can have tolerance for temperatures over 50 C. The present cell culture containers can contain additional materials other than PLA and PDA. If materials other than PLA and PDA are added, materials and/or their amounts preferably are selected such that the transparency of the resulting cell culture containers is maintained. For example, PEG polyethylene glycol, PPG polypropylene glycol, or other plasticizers can be added. Releasing agents, coloring agents, and/or crystallization agents can be added. Optionally, compounds can be added to improve transparency or to filter or block total transmission of ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as to provide color or to protect cells within the container from certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. Optionally, micro or nanoparticles can be added, for example, to block or partially filter UV light. Surface coatings such as poly-D-lysine, collagen, antibodies, or aptamers can optionally be added to the cell culture containers to enhance cell adhesion or selectively adhere certain desired cell types. For example, addition of carbonyl groups or addition of oxygen atoms to a growth surface of a cell culture container can improve cell adhesion, and the oxygen atoms can act as hydrogen bond acceptors. While not intending to limit the technology to any particular mechanism, the mixtures of PLA and PDA disclosed herein can be used to form cell culture containers can produce surfaces having exposed carbonyl groups or oxygen atoms without the need for any treatment or coating step. The exposed carbonyl groups or oxygen optionally can be combined with other functional groups. Such exposed carbonyl groups or oxygen atoms can increase the hydrophilicity of a surface. The present technology provides a method to produce cell adhesive, compostable biodegradable, and transparent, cell culture containers. The method can comprise mixing PLA with a selected percentage weight/weight of PDA. The percentage of PDA can be, for example, about 0. 5% to 50%, 1% to 50%, about 2% to 50%, about 2% to 30%, about 2% to 20%, about 2% to 10%, about 2% to 5%, about 1% to 20%, about 1% to 10%, about 1% to 5%, about 3% to 20%, about 3% to 10% about 4% to 20%, about 4% to 10%, about 5% to 20%, or about 5% to 10% by weight. Different mixtures or ranges of PDA content can be chosen depending on the intended use of the containers. For example, while 50% PDA can yield a higher Vicat softening temperature than a lower percentage, the use of 50% PDA also can increase the cost of a cell culture container. As another example, 1. 0% PDA can enable a cell culture container to withstand temperatures of 70 C. water see Example 1, but for some applications 5% PDA can be used so as to provide still higher thermal stability &gt;70 C. . Blends containing as little as 0. 5% PDA, if used with annealing, can yield a cell culture container capable of withstanding 70 C. water. The Mn or number average molecular weight of the PLA and the PDA utilized herein can be greater than about 1 KDa, greater than about 5 KDa, greater than about 10 KDa, greater than about 20 KDa, greater than about 30 KDa, greater than about 40 KDa, greater than about 50 KDa, greater than about 60 KDa, greater than about 70 KDa, greater than about 80 KDa, greater than about 90 KDa, greater than about 100 KDa, greater than about 200 KDa, greater than about 300 KDa, greater than about 400 KDa, and greater than about 500 KDa. The Mw or weight average molecular weight of the PLA and the PDA utilized herein can be greater than about 2 KDa, greater than about 10 KDa, greater than about 20 KDa, greater than about 40 KDa, greater than about 60 KDa, greater than about 80 KDa, greater than about 100 KDa, greater than about 120 KDa, greater than about 140 KDa, greater than about 160 KDa, greater than about 180 KDa, greater than about 200 KDa, greater than about 300 KDa, greater than about 400 KDa, greater than about 500 KDa, greater than about 600 KDa, greater than about 700 KDa, greater than about 800 KDa, greater than about 900 KDa, and greater than about 1000 KDa. The PLA and the PDA utilized herein can have high chiral purity such that greater than 95% of the S chiral centers are S or greater than 95% of the R chiral centers are R, greater than 98% of the S chiral centers are S or greater than 98% of the R chiral centers are R, and greater than 99% of the S chiral centers are S or greater than 99% of the R chiral centers are R, respectively. A method to produce a cell adhesive, compostable biodegradable, and transparent, cell culture container can consist essentially of mixing PLA 100X % with a percentage weight/weight of PDA X %. While the PLA and PDA are essential, other ingredients can be added that do not cause lack of transparency in a selected range from between about 380 to about 760 nm. Other ingredients can be added that do not make the mixture non-biodegradable. Other ingredients can be added that do not make the final cell culture container non-adherent to adherent cells. To consist essentially of can mean other ingredients besides PLA and PDA added do not cause lack of transparency, lack of biodegradability, or lack of cell adhesion in a cell culture container. To consist essentially of can mean that a suitable cell culture container is produced with viable adhesion for adhesive cells. A method to produce a cell adhesive, compostable biodegradable, and transparent, cell culture container can consist of mixing PLA 100X % with a percentage weight/weight of PDA X %. The percentage of PDA mixed with PLA can be selected from the range between 0. 1% and 50% weight/weight. An example of a method to produce a cell culture container is shown in the URE. The mixing of PLA and PDA, shown as 101, can be performed utilizing a mixture comprising PLA at 100X % weight/weight and PDA at X % weight/weight, where 100% corresponds to the total amount by weight of PLA+PDA in the mixture. The percent of X can be from 0. 1% to 50%. The mixing in 101 can be performed by any means known in the art, for example, tumbling, wet milling, dry milling, homogenization, sonic or acoustic, resonant mixing, and suspension mixing. The mixing in 101 can further comprise a drying step or any step to complete the mixing. A drying step can be to reduce moisture in the mixture before attempting a melting. A mixing step can be followed by, or can include, one or more drying steps for any purpose. A drying step is not limited in temperature or in vacuum conditions. For example, a drying step can employ a temperature from about 50 C. to 100 C. , about 60 C. to 90 C. , or about 70 C. to 80 C. The mixture can then be heated to a molding temperature in 102 using any means known in the art. The molding temperature is not limited. For example, a molding temperature can be selected from about 100 C. to 600 C. , about 125 C. to 300 C. , about 150 C. to 275 C. , or about 175 C. to 250 C. After heating to a molding temperature, injection molding can be utilized to shape a cell culture container. Injection molding can include high pressure injection of a mixture at or near a molding temperature. High pressure injection of a mixture of PLA and PDA can be utilized to form intricate parts or dimensions of larger components at or near the micrometer or nanometer scale. 3D printing can be utilized to mold, shape, or deposit a mixture of PLA and PDA into intricate parts or dimensions, and is particularly useful for making a small number of containers having a complex structure. Injection molding, or any suitable type of formation or shaping can occur at 103 wherein a shape of a cell culture container is formed from the mixture 101 at a molding temperature 102. The shape of the cell culture containers disclosed herein is not limited in any way, and the shape 105 can be a Petri dish, a culture flask, a roller bottle, a microwell or multiwell plate , 24-well, 96-well, 384-well plates, and any dish or container suitable for cell culture. 3D features can be separately molded; the 3D features, for example, can be inserts, beads 106, lattices, micro-scaffolds, sponge-like structures, spheroids, web-like structures, and surfaces with multiple growth arenas for cell culture. After the formation or shaping a cooling step can be performed at 103 to cool the shaped mixture such that the molded shape is retained. Cooling can be to any temperature suitable to stabilize a shape of the container or a component thereof. After injection molding, 3D printing, formation, or shaping at 103, an annealing step can be performed at 104. Annealing can improve the thermal stability of a cell culture container and can impart a crystallinity into the material which can improve thermal stability. Annealing generally refers to exposing the molded part to an selected temperature for a selected period of time, and can be carried out by any known process, such as tunnel annealing, oven annealing, heat lamp infra-red annealing, microwave annealing, radiation annealing, hot water bath annealing, hot air annealing, vacuum annealing, or sonic annealing. The annealing time can be about 1 to 15 minutes at a temperature in the range from about 20-75 C. , or can be about 20 seconds or more, such as 20-60 seconds, at 90 C. Annealing time and temperature can be varied depending on, for example, the percentage of PDA in mixture 101 higher levels of PDA enhance the annealing process, the desired Vicat softening temperature, the heat deflection temperature of products 105, 106, the thickness or shape of the product, or the desired optical clarity of the product excessive annealing reduces optical clarity. Annealing time and temperature also can be varied due to humidity conditions, properties of the mixture, additives other than PLA and PDA in the mixture, and desired crystal forms. Further, annealing time and temperature can be varied based upon the molecular weights of the PLA and the PDA polymers. If a sufficiently high annealing temperature is used, the time of annealing can be shortened such that annealing takes place within the mold, and no separate annealing process is required. See, for example, Product Data Sheet for LUMINY D070 from Total Corbion PLA BV, Revision 7 May 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference. It is within the routine skill in the art of plastics molding to routinely determine optimum annealing conditions for each molded part and polymer resin. In the present technology, the following parameters offer the best control over the annealing conditions: amount of PDA in the PLA/PDA mix, annealing temperature, and annealing time. The annealing conditions should be adjusted so as to obtain the desired heat stability of the part , as measured by Vicat softening temperature or other parameters and optical clarity for compatibility with light microscopy. Without intending to limit the technology to any particular mechanism, the annealing conditions are believed to impact the crystalline state of the polymers, which determine the heat stability and optical properties. A lid 107 can optionally be made from mixture 101. The lid 107 shown in the URE can be formed by 101, 102, 103, 104, for example. Lid 107 and container 105 can comprise, for example, inserts, extensions, rods, lattices, dividers, well, observation areas, and notches, threads, or grooves for fastening lid 107 to container 105. The container 105, the 3D spheroids or beads 106, and lid 107 shown in the URE can form a unit, which can be stackable, which can interlock with adjacent units, or which can be combined with other units to form a larger 3D cell culture container. Optionally, container 105 can form a unit alone. Lid 107 can be formed from an entirely different material than the body of the cell culture container, particularly if no cell growth is desired on the lid. Annealing can increase or cause a crystallization of the mixture comprising PLA and PDA. The crystallization can increase the heat tolerance of a cell culture container, for example, increasing the Vicat softening temperature or the heat deflection temperature. Annealing can be done at a time or a temperature that does not destroy the transparency of a cell culture container. For example, transparency can be halted when one or more crystal forms initiate change to a different crystal form. Annealing can cause a glass transition. Optionally, annealing can cause a transition to an amorphous form. Annealing can be performed in the injection mold or in the shaping of the cell culture container. Annealing can be performed after sterilization. The cell culture containers disclosed herein can have a Vicat softening temperature or a heat deflection temperature greater than about 50 C. , greater than about 60 C. , greater than about 70 C. , greater than about 80 C. , greater than about 90 C. , greater than about 100 C. , greater than about 110 C. , greater than about 120 C. , and greater than about 130 C. Thermal stability of the cell culture containers disclosed herein can be measured by incubating the cell culture containers in air for 30 minutes at a testing temperature and by observing whether any visible warping of a flat bottom of the cell culture containers occurs. Thermal stability of the cell culture containers disclosed herein can be greater than about 60 C. , greater than about 65 C. , greater than about 70 C. , greater than about 75 C. , greater than about 80 C. , greater than about 85 C. , greater than about 90 C. , greater than about 95 C. , greater than about 100 C. , greater than about 110 C. , greater than about 120 C. , and greater than about 130 C. A growth surface area of a cell culture container can be larger than about 1 mm2, larger than about 1 cm2, larger than about 5 cm2, than about 50 cm2, larger than about 100 cm2, larger than about 1 m2, larger than about 5 m2, or larger than about 10 m2. The cell culture containers disclosed herein can have 3D features causing a large growth surface area to volume ratio in the cell culture containers. Growth surface area to volume can be measured by dividing growth surface area by volume. For example, 8 cm2 divided by 2 cm3=4 cm1. The growth surface area to volume ratio of the cell culture containers disclosed herein can have any desired value, or can be at least about 0. 1 cm1, at least about 0. 5 cm1, at least about 1 cm1, at least about 5 cm1, at least about 10 cm1, at least about 25 cm1, at least about 50 cm1, or at least about 100 cm1. The cell culture containers disclosed herein preferably can contain hot water or hot aqueous solutions without deforming. For example, hot water can be poured into the cell culture containers without deformation of the cell culture containers. Optionally, the cell culture containers disclosed herein can withstand, without deformation, hot water at a temperature greater than about 70 C. , greater than about 75 C. , greater than about 80 C. , greater than about 85 C. , greater than about 90 C. , greater than about 95 C. , or greater than about 100 C. Optionally, agar can be gelled in a cell culture container disclosed herein without deforming the container. The cell culture containers disclosed herein can be transparent. Transparency can be measured by total transmittance. For example, total transmittance can equal incident light minus absorption+reflection. Optionally, the total transmittance of the cell culture containers disclosed herein can be greater than 10%, greater than 20%, greater than 30%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 80%, or greater than 90%. Transparency can indicate lack of components or crystal forms with different indices of refraction. Transparency can be measured in one or more ranges or in one or narrow bands in the visible light spectrum from about 380 or 400 nm to about 700, 740, or 760 nanometers. Certain ranges between about 380 to about 760 nanometers can be made non-transparent for specific cell cultures, for example, by coatings, additives, or treatments , annealing. Coatings, additives, or treatments , annealing can be applied to block or to inhibit electromagnetic waves in any desired range of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. If only one or more selected wavelength ranges are blocked, the cell culture container is still generally considered to be transparent. Particulates can be added to the mixture of PLA and PDA during mixing or after mixing. The particulates can be utilized, for example, for heat IR or UV absorption, and the particles may lower total transmittance while allowing transparency in one or more ranges between 380 to about 760 nm. The cell culture containers can be sterilized after annealing. Optionally, sterilization can be accomplished by annealing or by a sterile manufacturing technique. Sterilization can be performed by any means known in the art, such as gamma irradiation or irradiation by a particle beam or electron beam. The cell culture containers disclosed herein can be manufactured by mixing about 0. 1% to about 50% PDA with PLA, melting the mixture to a suitable molding temperature, molding the melted mixture, cooling to a suitable release temperature, and then annealing the cell culture container. If pure PLA and PDA are utilized, the cell culture containers can comprise carbonyl groups extending from the PLA and PDA on the outer surfaces. The carbonyl groups can act as hydrogen bond acceptors. The cell culture containers can retain a water droplet, about 100 microliters in volume, without movement of the water droplet, at an angle in non-limiting examples, from about 0-75, about 0-65, about 0-45, about 0-35, about 0-25, about 0-20, about 0-17, about 0-15, and about 0-12. Electron beam irradiation , 25 kGy, 45 kGy, 55 kGy can increase the hydrophilicity. The cell culture containers disclosed herein can be utilized for culture of either suspension or suspension-adapted cell types or for anchorage-dependent/adherent cell types, eukaryotic cells, and prokaryotic cells. In the cell culture containers disclosed herein, bacterial E. coli can be grown in any suitable medium. Luria Broth bacterial growth medium 1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, and 0. 5% yeast extract in water with 2% dissolved agar is a non-limiting example of a suitable medium. Yeast cells can be grown in the cell culture containers disclosed herein. Surprisingly, the technology disclosed herein can provide cell culture containers for adherent cells without surface treatment or coating. The cell culture containers provided herein also can be used for cells that grow in suspension, or that grow both in suspension and attached to a surface or to other cells. The containers can be used for culturing cells derived from multicellular eukaryotes, animal cells, such as mammalian cells, including human cells, plant tissue or cell culture, fungal culture, and microbiological culture. Viral culture can be accomplished, for example, in the eukaryotic cells grown in the containers. For growth upon untreated and uncoated surfaces, any suitable growth or culture medium can be used. An example of a growth medium for eukaryotic cell growth is DMEM medium Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 I. /ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. The container can be placed in a 37 C. incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Because the growth surfaces of the containers provided herein do not necessitate treatment or coating before cultivation or growth, large surface area growth surfaces, 3D growth surfaces, and intricate growth surfaces can readily be produced more conveniently and at less cost than containers requiring surface treatment or coating. Cell culture containers according to the present technology can sustain the viability of cells cultured therein. Both suspension-growing or suspension-adapted and anchorage-dependent cells can be viably sustained by containers of the present technology, as well as cells such as bacteria, yeast, or other fungi which grow on gelled culture medium. The viability sustaining feature of the containers can be assayed by any of a variety of known methods. For example, see promega. com/resources/guides/cell-biology/cell-viability/. Cell viability can vary depending on the cell species, seeding density, age of the cell culture following seeding, and other factors. Cell culture containers of the present technology can be assessed, for example, by determining the fraction of cells that are measured as ATP positive. Cell culture containers of the present technology can be viability sustaining, for example, in that they maintain greater than 50%, or greater than 60%, or greater than 70%, or greater than 80%, or greater than 90% of cells in the culture as ATP positive at 24 hours after seeding the culture. The technology described herein can provide cell culture containers of any size or shape for cell cultivation. The transparent cell culture containers disclosed herein and the methods disclosed herein can be utilized for cultivation, growth, sustenance, or multiplication of bacteria, Archaea e. g, prokaryotes, Protozoa, Chromista , algae, plants, fungi, animal cells, viruses, or prions. The cell culture containers can be utilized for replication of DNA, RNA, amyloids, oligonucleotides, and polypeptides. For detaching adherent cells, the cell culture containers can be used with any detachment method known in the art, for example, by introducing trypsin into the container. Because the cell culture containers of the present technology are highly versatile, in that they can be utilized to culture a wide variety of different cell types, including anchorage-dependent cells, cells growing in suspension, cells adapted to growing in suspension, and cells growing on gelled media, the use of these cell culture containers can reduce the size, complexity, and cost of inventory for a research or cell production facility. The technology described herein can be produced using 3D printing. For example, a mixture comprising poly-L-lactide at 100X % weight/weight and poly-D-lactide at X % weight/weight, wherein X % is 0. 1% to 50%, is introduced into a 3D printer. The heating element of the 3D printer can heat the mixture to a molding temperature. The robotic or moving printing head of the 3D printer can mold the mixture in the shape of a cell culture container or almost any shape. The shaped or formed mixture can be cooled. The shaped or formed mixture can be annealed to form a transparent cell culture container, a 3D structure such as a cell scaffold for adherent cell culture and growth.",
