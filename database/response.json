                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "The present disclosure relates to a development device which develops an electrostatic latent image formed on a photosensitive drum by a nonmagnetic one-component developer, and an image forming apparatus including the development device. An image forming apparatus such as a printer includes a development device which develops an electrostatic latent image formed on a photosensitive drum by a nonmagnetic one-component developer. As the development device, a contact type nonmagnetic one-component development device is known. The development device includes a development roller which forms a toner image on the photosensitive drum and a supply roller which supplies the toner to the development roller. In such a contact type nonmagnetic one-component development device, the toner is directly rubbed by the supply roller to the development roller to be triboelectrically charged, and at the same time, the toner is attracted to the development roller and conveyed to the photosensitive drum by the development roller. Then, the photosensitive drum and the development roller are brought into contact with each other and rotated to develop the toner on the photosensitive drum. As a result, members such as a magnet, a metal sleeve, and a carrier are not required unlike in a conventional two-component development device or a non-contact jumping one-component development device, and it is not required to apply an AC bias to the development roller. Thus, stable development performance can be obtained in a simple and low-cost configuration. Further, since the development roller comes into contact with the photosensitive drum, it becomes possible to collect the toner on the photosensitive drum into the development device, and the cleaning blade becomes unnecessary cleaning blade less, thereby making not only the structure of the development device but also the entire structure around the photosensitive drum simple. For the reasons described above, the contact type nonmagnetic one-component development device is widely used mainly in a low-speed compact image forming apparatus and printer. In such a development device, by setting an arithmetic average surface roughness and a surface energy of the surface of the development roller, and an Asker F hardness of the supply roller to respective predetermined ranges, generation of an afterimage caused by the undeveloped toner remaining on the unevenness of the surface of the development roller can be prevented, and the density of the image can be increased by increasing a carrying force of the developer. However, the above-described technique has a problem that it is difficult to secure a development bias setting range in which both the target image density and the cleaning property of the undeveloped toner can be achieved, over a long period of time.",

The fixing part 40 includes a fixing roller 41 in which a heating source is stored, and a pressing roller 42 coming into pressure contact with the fixing roller 41. Between the fixing roller 41 and the pressing roller 42, a fixing nip area is formed. When the sheet to which the toner image is transferred is passed through the fixing nip area, the toner image is heated by the fixing roller 41 and pressed by the pressing roller 42, and then fixed on the sheet. In the present embodiment, a melt viscosity Pss of the nonmagnetic one-component toner used in the development device 33 at 95 c. is set within a range of 100,000 or more and 200,000 or less. In the main housing 10, a main conveyance path 22F and an inversion conveyance path 22B are provided for conveying the sheet. The main conveyance path 22F extends from the sheet feeding part 21A of the sheet feeding part 20 to a discharge port 14 provided so as to face of the discharge part 13 on the top face of the main housing 10 via the image forming part 30 and the fixing part 40. The inversion conveyance path 22B is a conveyance path for conveying the sheet printed on one face to the upstream side of the image forming part 30 on the main conveyance path 22F when the both-face printing is performed on the sheet. The main conveyance path 22F is formed through the transferring nip area between the photosensitive drum 31 and the transferring roller 34 from the lower side to the upper side. On the upstream side of the transferring nip area on the main conveyance path 22F, a registration rollers pair 23 is disposed. The sheet is stopped by the registration rollers pair 23, and then fed to the transferring nip area at a timing suitable for image transferring after the skew of the sheet is corrected. At suitable positions on the main conveyance path 22F and the inversion conveyance path 22B, a plurality of conveyance rollers for conveying the sheet is disposed, and a discharge rollers pair 24 is disposed near the discharge port 14, for example. The inversion conveyance path 22B is formed between the outer side face of an inversion unit 25 and the inner face of the rear cover 12 of the main housing 10. The transferring roller 34 and one roller of the registration rollers pair 23 are mounted on the inner face of the inversion unit 25. The rear cover 12 and the inversion unit 25 are each rotatable around an axis of a fulcrum part 121 provided at their lower end portions. When a sheet jamming occurs on the inversion conveyance path 22B, the rear cover 12 is opened. When a sheet jamming occurs on the main conveying path 22F, or when the unit of the photosensitive drum 31 or the development device 33 is detached to the outside, the inversion unit 25 is also opened in addition to the rear cover 12. 2 is a sectional view showing a structure around the photosensitive drum 31. In this embodiment, the transferring roller 34 is disposed so as to come into contact with the photosensitive drum 31 on the rear side of the photosensitive drum 31, and the charging device 32 is disposed so as to face the photosensitive drum 31 at a predetermined interval on the front and upper side of the photosensitive drum 31. The transferring nip area is formed between the photosensitive drum 31 and the transferring roller 34, and the sheet passes through the transferring nip area as indicated by the arrow in 2. At this time, the toner image is transferred from the photosensitive drum 31 to the sheet. The development device 33 is disposed so as to face the photosensitive drum 31 on the front and lower side of the photosensitive drum 31. The development device 33 includes a development housing 330, a development roller 331, a supply roller 332, an agitating paddle 333, a regulating blade 334 a layer thickness regulating member, and a lower seal 335 a sealing member. The development housing 330 stores the nonmagnetic one-component toner. The development housing 330 includes a housing main body 330A and a housing lid 330B. As shown in 2, in the rear end portion of the development housing 330, an opening for exposing a part of the development roller 331 to the photosensitive drum 31 is formed. The development roller 331 is supported by the development housing 330 in a rotatable manner, and has a circumferential face on which the toner is carried. The development roller 331 comes into contact with photosensitive drum 31, and forms a development nip area together with the photosensitive drum 31 for supplying the toner to the photosensitive drum 31. The development roller 331 has a shaft made of SUS or SUM, and a cylindrical rubber layer an elastic body around the shaft. The rubber layer is made of NBR Nitril-Butadiene rubber, for example. A predetermined coating layer may be formed around the rubber layer. In the present embodiment, an Asker-C hardness of the surface of the development roller 331 is set within a range of 50 or more and 80 or less. The development roller 331 is applied with a development bias of a direct voltage. Owing to a difference in potential between the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum 31 and the development roller 331 applied with the development bias, the toner is attracted to the photosensitive drum 31 from the development roller 331. The supply roller 332 is disposed so as to face the development roller 331 on the front and lower side of the development roller 331, and supported by the development housing 220 in a rotatable manner. The supply roller 332 comes into contact with the development roller 331, and forms a supply nip area for supplying the toner to the development roller 331. The supply roller 332 has a predetermined shaft a shaft member made of metal, and a cylindrical urethane sponge or foamed sponge both are an elastic foamed member fixed around the shaft. In the present embodiment, an Asker-FP hardness of the surface of the supply roller 332 is set within a range of 40 or more to 60 or less. A width of the supply nip area is set within a range of 0. 2 mm or more and 1. 5 mm or less in the rotational direction when viewed along the radial direction. The agitating paddle 333 is supported by the development housing 330 in a rotatable manner on the front side of the supply roller 332. The agitating paddle 333 includes a shaft having a L-shaped cross section as shown in 2 and a PET film extending radially from the shaft. 2 shows rotational directions of the development roller 331, the supply roller 332 and the agitating paddle 333 when the image forming processing to the sheet is performed in the image forming apparatus 1. The development roller 331 rotates such that its surface moves in the same direction as the surface of the photosensitive drum 31 at the development nip area the development roller 331 rotates in a direction opposite to the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 31. As an example, a circumferential speed ratio of the development roller 331 to the photosensitive drum 31 is set to 1. 55. The supply roller 332 rotates such that its surface moves in a direction opposite to the surface of the development roller 331. A circumferential speed ratio of the development roller 331 to the supply roller 332 is set to 1. 55. The agitating paddle 333 rotates so as to scoop the toner in the development housing 330 and to supply it to the supply roller 332. The regulating blade 334 comes into contact with the surface the circumferential face of the development roller 331 on the downstream side of the supply nip area in the rotational direction of the development roller 331 and on the upstream side of the development nip area in the rotational direction of the development roller 331. The regulating blade 334 is fixed to the development housing 330 so as to be inclined toward the upstream side in the rotational direction of the development roller 331. The regulating blade 334 regulates a thickness a layer thickness of the toner on the development roller 331. The lower seal 335 is supported by the housing main body 330A so as to be close to a gap between the development roller 331 and the housing main body 330A on a side opposite to the regulating blade 334. The tip end portion of the lower seal 335 comes into contact with the surface of the development roller 331. In the present embodiment, as shown in 2, the so-called cleanerless configuration is adopted in which the charging device 32 is disposed on the downstream side of the photosensitive drum 31 in the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 31 as viewed from the transferring nip area between the photosensitive drum 31 and the transferring roller 34, and a known cleaning device is not provided. That is, when the toner image is transferred from the photosensitive drum 31 to the sheet at the transferring nip area, the untransferred toner remains on the photosensitive drum 31. The untransferred toner passes through the charging device 32 and is collected from the photosensitive drum 31 by the development roller 331 of the development device 33. At this time, when the images the toner images are continuously formed on the sheet, the development roller 331 collects the untransferred toner from the photosensitive drum 31 and supplies the toner to the electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum 31. On the other hand, the supply roller 332 supplies the new toner to the development roller 331 at the supply nip area and collects the toner not supplied to the photosensitive drum 31 from the development roller 331 from the development roller 331. 3 is an enlarged sectional view showing an area where the development roller 331 faces the supply roller 332 in the development device 33 according to the embodiment of the present disclosure. In the embodiment, the shaft of the development roller 331 and the shaft of the supply roller 332 are supported by the development housing 330 such that the surface of the development roller 331 bites the surface of the supply roller 332 by a biting amount H. As a result, between the development roller 331 and the supply roller 332, a supply nip area SN having a predetermined width along their rotational directions is formed. Because the supply roller 332 has a hardness smaller than the development roller 331, as shown in 3, the surface of the supply roller 332 is mainly deformed to form the supply nip area SN. Therefore, when the development roller 331 and the supply roller 332 are rotated, the toner supplied by the supply roller 332 remains on the upstream side of the supply nip area SN, and a toner accumulation TN is formed. The toner accumulation TN allows to supply the toner from the supply roller 332 to the development roller 331 stably even if the high-density image is formed on the photosensitive drum 31. On the other hand, when the development roller 331 and the supply roller 332 may come into point contact with each other in the sectional view, because the sufficient toner accumulation TN shown in 3 is not formed, a toner supply performance may be remarkably decreased. Therefore, it is necessary to set a center distance a shaft distance between the development roller 331 and the supply roller 332 and their diameters so as to have an appropriate biting amount H. An asker-C hardness of the development roller 331 is set within a range of 50 or more and 80 or less because the development roller 331 comes into contact with the hard member such as the photosensitive drum 31. Accordingly, in order to have the configuration in which the development roller 331 bites the supply roller 332 as shown in 3, it is necessary to set a hardness of the supply roller 332 smaller than the development roller 331. &lt;Usable Range of Development Bias&gt; 4 is a graph showing a relationship between a development bias and an image density in a nonmagnetic one-component development device. The image density is shown by a reflection density on the sheet measured using a TC-6DX manufactured by TokyoDenshoku. Co. , Ltd. In the following graph, the image density is shown in the same manner. A performance of the image forming apparatus to which a contact type nonmagnetic one-component development system in which the development roller 331 comes into contact with the circumferential face of the photosensitive drum 31 and a cleanerless system a cleaning bladeless system are adopted is represented as a development sensitivity property shown in 4. The development bias applied to the development roller 331 is adjusted such that an image density on the sheet has the preset target density and cleaning failure collecting failure is not generated on the photosensitive drum 31. The image density corresponds to an amount of the toner moved from the development roller 331 to the photosensitive drum 31 a development amount, and varies depending on a difference in potential between the photosensitive drum 31 after exposed and a development bias a direct voltage. The generation of the cleaning failure is varied depending on a difference in potential between a surface potential of the photosensitive drum 31 a potential of a background and a development bias. Thus, there is a usage range of the development bias in which the target image density is obtained and the cleaning failure does not occur. 4 shows a relationship between a development bias and an image density under various conditions including a condition where the image forming apparatus 1 is in an initial state represented as the black circles, and conditions where the image forming apparatus 1 has been used for a long period of time durability and a surrounding environment of the image forming apparatus 1 changes represented as the white rectangles. The usable range of the development bias is shown as a range where the target image density 1. 3 or more is obtained, an insufficiency of the image density is not generated, and the cleaning failure the collection failure does not occur, in the conditions. In consideration of a potential unevenness on the photosensitive drum 31, a deterioration of the toner and a variation in the development sensitivity owing to an environment humidity and temperature, the usable range of the development bias is preferably set in a range of at least 120 V. It is important for the contact type nonmagnetic one-component development system to secure the usable range as wide as possible. &lt;Pressing Force of Development Roller and Image Density&gt; 5 is a graph showing a relationship between a development bias and an image density in the nonmagnetic one-component development device. 5 shows graphs of the cases where a pressing force a contact pressure of the development roller 331 against the photosensitive drum 31 is changed at three levels the pressing force is low, medium, or high. 6 is a view showing a state where a pulling force in the development nip area is measured in the nonmagnetic one-component development device. 7 is a graph showing a distribution of the pulling force in the development nip area of the development device 33 according to the present embodiment. In the development device 33 according to the present embodiment, the photosensitive drum 31 is directly brought into pressure contact with the development roller 331, and the development sensitivity is changed by the pressing force at this time. As shown in 5, when the pressing force is too large, an image density is insufficient in a region where the development bias is low, and white void is generated in the halftone image. The mechanism of this phenomenon is inferred as follows. The larger the pressing force of the development roller 331 against the photosensitive drum 31 is, the larger the micro-contact area between the toner and the surface of the development roller is, and the larger the adhesion force of the toner to the development roller 331 is. As a result, the toner hardly separates from the development roller 331, the development amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is decreased, and the image density is thus lowered. On the other hand, if the pressing force is too small, the development roller 331 hardly collects the untransferred toner also called the remaining toner on the photosensitive drum 31, and the cleaning failure thus occurs. Therefore, the pressing force of the development roller 331 has an appropriate range, and it is required to secure the pressing force along the longitudinal direction the axial direction of the development roller 331 as uniform as possible. In the present embodiment, the pressing force of the development roller 331 is indirectly evaluated by substituting a pulling force using a PET film for the pressing force at the development nip area during the rotation of the photosensitive drum 31 and the development roller 331. As shown in 6, a PET film having an axial width of 20 mm and a thickness of 50 m is held between the photosensitive drum 31 and the development roller 331, and the pulling force applied to the PET film shown by PF in 6 when the photosensitive drum 31 and the development roller 331 were rotated was measured by a push-pull gauge 50 disposed on the upstream side of the development roller 331 in the rotational direction of the development roller 331 as viewed from the development nip area. As shown in 7, when the pressing force of the development roller 331 against the photosensitive drum 31 at the development nip area is substituted by the above-described pulling force, when the pulling force is below 0. 9 N, the collection failure cleaning failure occurs, and when it exceeds 1. 4 N, the white void is generated in the halftone image. Therefore, it is desirable that the pulling force be set to an appropriate range from 0. 9 N or more and 1. 4 N or less over the entire axial direction of the development roller 331. That is, in the development device 33 of the nonmagnetic one-component system, when the usable range of the development bias and the appropriate range of the pressing force of the development roller are secured as widely as possible, the simple and low-cost image forming apparatus 1 can be provided. In order to realize the image forming apparatus 1 provided with the above development device 33, the inventors of the present disclosure have carried out intensive experiments, and have newly found that there is a close relationship between a surface free energy of the development roller 331 and the development ability the development sensitivity. The above experiment will be described in detail below. As the experimental machine, a remodeled printer of a printer ECOSYS FS-1040 manufactured by Kyocera Document Solutions was used. Table 1 shows more detailed experimental conditions. TABLE 1 MEMBER ITEM CHARACTERISTIC REMARK DEVELOPMENT MATERIAL SILICON RUBBER + URETHANE NOK Co. Ltd.

In this experiment, three kinds of development rollers 331 having surface free energies of the outer layer different from each other 12, 21, 30 mJ/m2 were prepared. In the present embodiment, although a urethane resin coating is employed as the surface layer coating of the development roller 331, in order to reduce the surface free energy, another material having fluorine or silicone in the molecular structure is added to the urethane, and the surface free energy is adjusted by increasing or decreasing the amount of the material. The surface free energy of the development roller 331 was measured by an OCA 20 manufactured by Hidehiro Seiki. As shown in 8, it was confirmed that the smaller the surface free energy of the development roller 331 is, the higher the image density is and the better the development ability is even if the development bias is low. It is inferred that this phenomenon is caused by the fact that the lower the surface free energy is, the lower the non-electrostatic adhesion force between the development roller 331 and the toner is. As described above, in the present embodiment, the adhesion force between the toner and the surface of the development roller 331 is adjusted by adjusting the surface free energy of the development roller 331, and as a result, the development ability of the toner is adjusted. As another method for adjusting the surface free energy, a powder of zinc stearate may be previously applied to the surface of the development roller 331, and an amount of the zinc stearate applied to surface may be adjusted in order to reduce the surface free energy. However, in this case, since the zinc stearate powder may sequentially fall off as the development roller 331 rotates, it is difficult to confirm the long-term effect as compared with the above-described method in which the molecular structure is changed. However, it was confirmed that the same results as those shown in 8 can be obtained only by the experiment for verifying the contribution of the surface free energy to the development ability. 9 is a graph showing a relationship between the surface free energy of the development roller 331 and the development bias usable range in the development device 33 according to the present embodiment. 9 shows an evaluation of the width of the usable range of the development bias in each development roller 331 by performing the same evaluation as in 4 in each development roller 331 whose surface free energy is changed as described above. 9 shows how the width of the usable range in which the target image density is a reflection density of 1. 3 or more and the cleaning failure does not occur is changed with respect to the surface free energy. Because the target value of the usable range of the development bias is A120 V or more, the target can be achieved if the surface free energy is 27 mJ/m2 or less. It should be noted that the smaller the surface free energy is, the better the development ability is, but the value of the development bias at which the cleaning failure does not occur does not change. 10 is a graph showing a relationship between the surface free energy of the development roller 331 and the pulling force in the development nip area in the development device 33 according to the present embodiment. In the three development rollers 331 having different surface free energies, an appropriate range of the pressing force the pulling force of the PET film was obtained as shown in 10, from a limit value due to the white void in the halftone image and a limit value due to the occurrence of the cleaning failure. As shown in 10, as the surface free energy of the development roller 331 is lower, the insufficiency of the image density that occurs when the pressing force in the development nip area is large is less likely to occur, and the appropriate range of the pressing force the pulling force becomes wider. The two graphs of the limit of the white void in the halftone image shown in 10 are obtained by linearly regressing the limits of the white void in the halftone image in the development rollers 331 having three different surface free energies, and are graphs under two conditions in which the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is different from each other. As described above, from the viewpoint of the development bias usable range 9, it has been found that the surface free energy E of the development roller 331 is preferably set to 27 mJ/m2 or less, and at this time, in order to prevent the cleaning failure 10, the pulling force F at the development nip area preferably satisfies 0. 8 NF, and further, in order to prevent the generation of the white void in the halftone image 10, when the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is 1. 2 J/cm2, by setting the pulling force F to equal to or less than the graph based on the black circle data in 10, that is, by satisfying F0. 0389E+2. 2833, good image quality is obtained. In addition, it has been found that in order to prevent the generation of the white void in the halftone image 10, when the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is 1. 6 J/cm2, by setting the pulling force F to equal to or less than the graph based on the white square data in 10, that is, by satisfying F0. 0389E+2. 5833, good image quality can be obtained. As a result of examining the above two graphs, the present inventors have newly found that when the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is increased, it becomes possible to expand a region where the white void in the halftone image is not generated to a side where the pulling force F is large. It is inferred that this is caused by the fact that, by increasing the exposure amount, the more amount of the toner is developed for the fine toner image 1 dot constituting the halftone image, and the influence of the development performance is reduced. Further, in the case of a positively charged drum like the photosensitive drum 31 according to the present embodiment, when the exposure amount by the exposure devices 35 is increased, the potential of the image formed portion on the photosensitive drum 31 becomes lower closer to 0 V. At this time, it is inferred that, since a difference in potential between the exposed portion the image formed portion, 1 dot portion and the unexposed portion the no-image formed portion, a blank portion around the 1 dot portion is further increased and a sneak electric field is increased the electric lines of force are densely packed, a toner holding force on the surface of the photosensitive drum 31 is increased, and the white void in the halftone image is less likely generated. Further, when the exposure amount is increased as described above, it is inferred that because a size of 1 dot is increased, a development pressure a pressure with which the development roller 331 is pressed on the photosensitive drum 31 becomes large, and a change in the density is difficulty viewed even if the development property decreases. When the exposure amount is increased and the size of 1 dot on the photosensitive drum 31 is increased, the density of the halftone image is originally increased, but since the density of a dot is adjusted for each gradation of the halftone image in the image processing in the image forming apparatus 1, the density on the naked eye is adjusted to be substantially equal even when the exposure amount is actually increased. Table 2 shows each image evaluation result when the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is increased or decreased. 11 is a graph showing a relationship between the exposure amount and the surface potential of the photosensitive drum 31 according to the present embodiment. 12 is a graph showing a relationship between the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum and the image quality, and visualizes the results of Table 2. In the evaluation shown in Table 2, the experiments were carried out using the development roller 331 having the surface free energy of 12 mJ/m2. TABLE 2 SURFACE FREE ENERGY OF OUTER LAYER OF EXPOSURE RESOLUTION PET FILM PULLING DEVELOPMENT ROLLER AMOUNT CHARACTER, BLURRING FORCE N mJ/m2 J/cm2 IMAGE DENSITY FINE LINE OF CHARACTER WHEN WHITE VOID OCCURS 12 0. 8 x INSUFFICIENT x BREAKS 1. 2 0. 9 x INSUFFICIENT x BREAKS 1. 4 1. 0 x BREAKS 1. 1 x BREAKS 1. 2 1. 8 1. 3 1. 4 1. 5 1. 6 2. 1 1. 7 x BLURRING 1. 8 x BLURRING 1. 9 x BLURRING 2. 0 x BLURRING 2. 3As shown in Table 2, it is found that the larger the exposure amount is, the larger the pulling force F corresponding to a generation limit of the white void in the halftone image is. Further, if the exposure amount is too small, the sufficiency of the image density and breaks of a character image and a fine line occur. On the other hand, if the exposure amount is too large, the toner is excessively developed, and failures such as blurring of a character image occur. As a result, as shown in 12, the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is preferably set to a range of 1. 2 J/m2 or more and 1. 6 J/m2 or less. It becomes possible to make the cost of the photosensitive drum 31 low by decreasing an amount of a material for exhibiting a photoconductive action, such as a charge generating material or a charge transporting material contained in the photosensitive layer of the photosensitive drum 31 as small as possible. Because the smaller the amount of these materials is, the lower the sensitivity of the photosensitive drum 31 is, a relatively large exposure amount is required. In other words, by using the photosensitive drum 31 having a relatively low sensitivity, it becomes possible to increase the exposure amount at the time of the normal image formation, and it becomes possible to widen the area where the white void in the halftone image is not generated. As shown in 11, in the photosensitive drum 31 according to the present embodiment, the surface potential is reduced by half to 50% by setting the exposure amount to 0. 30 J/cm2 in both cases where the dark potential, that is the initial charge potential is 640 V and 500 V. That is, when the halved exposure amount, which is the exposure amount by which the surface potential of the photosensitive drum 31 is reduced by half, is 0. 30 J/cm2 or more, the sensitivity of the photosensitive drum 31 becomes relatively low as described above, so that it becomes possible to increase the exposure amount at a time of the normal image formation, and it becomes possible to stably expand the area where the white void in the halftone image is not generated. As shown in 11, in the case of the photosensitive drum 31 having the same material structure, the halved exposure amount is substantially constant regardless of the initial surface potential dark potential. As described above, in the case where the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is 1. 2 J/cm2 or less, when the pulling force F is equal to or below the graph based on the black circle data in 10, that is when F0. 0389E+2. 5833 is satisfied, good image quality without the white void in the halftone image can be obtained. On the other hand, in the case where the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is 1. 6 J/cm2, it has been found that when the pulling force F is equal to or less than the graph based on the white square data in 10, that is, F0. 0389E+2. 5833 is satisfied, good image quality without the white void in the halftone image can be obtained. That is, it has been newly found that when the exposure amount to the photosensitive drum 31 is increased, it becomes possible to expand a region where the white void in the halftone image is not generated to a side where the pulling force F is large. 13 is a graph showing a relationship between the exposure amount for the 100% solid image to the photosensitive drum 31 and the y-intercept of the graph of 10. In 13, the inventors have newly derived the following equation 1 as a regression line passing through 2 points, where the exposure amounts of 1. 2 J/m2 and 1. 6 J/cm2 to the photosensitive drum 31 are plotted on the horizontal axis, and 2. 2833 and 2. 5833, which are the y-intercepts of the corresponding linear equations, are plotted on the vertical axis. y=0. 75x+1. 3833Equation 1. Therefore, in 10, a boundary line the black circle data and the white square data in 10 of the pulling force of the PET film at which the white void in the halftone image is not generated is changed so as to satisfy the following Equation 2 by using the value of the surface free energy E of the surface layer of the development roller 331 and the exposure amount G to the photosensitive drum 31 as variables. F0. 0389E+0. 75G+1. 3833Equation 2. In the above evaluation, it has been found that when the surface free energy E of the development roller 331 lowers below 5 mJ/m2, the adhesion force of the toner on the development roller 331 becomes too low, and the toner is hardly attracted to the development roller 331 when the toner is supplied from the supply roller 332 to the development roller 331, and the stability of the toner layer is lowered. Therefore, the surface free energy E is preferably set in a range of 5 mJ/m2 or more and 27 mJ/m2 or less. As described above, according to the present embodiment, in a state where the surface free energy E of the development roller 331 is contained in a range of 5 mJ/m2 or more and 27 mJ/m2 or less and the toner carrying amount on the development roller 331 regulated by the regulating blade 334 is set in a range from 1 g/m2 or more to 10 g/m2 or less, when the value of the pulling force is set to F N and the surface free energy of the development roller 331 is set to E mJ/m2, the relational expression of 0. 8F0. 0389E+2. 2833 is satisfied, in which the pulling force is obtained in such a manner that a PET film having a thickness of 50 m is held in the development nip area and then a force applied to the film is measured on the upstream side of the development nip area in the rotational direction of the development roller 331 when the film is pulled toward the downstream side in the rotational direction of the development roller 331 as the photosensitive drum 31 and the development roller 331 are rotated. Further, according to the present embodiment, in a state where the photosensitive drum 31 is emitted with exposure light at an exposure amount of 1. 2 J/cm2 or more and 1. 6 J/cm2 or less in accordance with image information of the 100% solid image, the surface free energy E of the development roller 331 is contained in a range of 5 mJ/m2 or more and 27 mJ/m2 or less, and the toner carrying amount on the development roller 331 regulated by the regulating blade 334 is set in a range of 1 g/m2 or more and 10 g/m2 or less, when the value of the pulling force is set to F N, the surface free energy of the development roller 331 is set to E mJ/m2 and the exposure amount is G J/cm2, the relational equation of 0. 8F0. 0389E+0. 75G+1. 3833 is satisfied, in which the pulling force is obtained in such a manner that a PET film having a thickness of 50 m is held in the development nip area and then a force applied to the film is measured on the upstream side of the development nip area in the rotational direction of the development roller when the film is pulled toward the downstream side in the rotational direction of the development roller as the photosensitive drum and the development roller are rotated. As described above, by setting the surface free energy of the development roller 331 within a predetermined range, the development ability can be improved, the usable range of the development bias and the pressing setting range of the development roller can be made more wider, and stable image formation can be achieved even in a simple and low-cost configuration. In the present embodiment, the development roller 331 has the rubber layer as an elastic body and the coating layer formed around the surface of the rubber layer. According to this configuration, the development ability of the development roller 331 can be stably maintained. In another embodiment, the development roller 331 may be formed by polishing the surface of the rubber layer the base layer rubber of the base layer without having the coating layer as described above. On the other hand, by providing the coating layer as described above, it becomes possible to accurately and independently control the surface roughness, the surface free energy and the others of the development roller 331 without being affected by the property of the base layer rubber. In particular, the surface roughness can be controlled by dispersing resin or silica beads in the coating layer, and the surface free energy can be increased or decreased by changing the material as described above. The electric resistance of the development roller 331 may also be changed by increasing or decreasing the amount of ion conductive agent or carbon in the coating agent constituting the coating layer. As described above, since the development roller 331 has the coating layer, it becomes possible to obtain a desired quality and a characteristic suitable for the cost. In this embodiment, the development housing 330 stores the toner produced by a pulverizing method. When the toner used in the development device 33 is a polymerized toner having a high degree of circularity, the same effect as described above can be obtained, but since the polymerized toner is originally spherical, the adhesion force of the toner to the surface of the development roller 331 is low and the development ability is good, so that the development bias usable range is wide. On the other hand, in the present embodiment, even if the pulverized toner, which is ununiform as compared with the polymerized toner and has a high adhesion force to the surface of the development roller 331, is used, the development ability can be improved, the development bias usable range and the pressing setting range of the developing roller can be made wider, and stable image formation can be achieved. As a result, the low-cost image forming apparatus 1 can be realized by using the pulverized toner whose cost is lower than the polymerized toner. The image forming apparatus 1 according to the present embodiment has a cleanerless structure in which a cleaning member a cleaning blade, a cleaning brush for cleaning the untransferred toner remaining on the photosensitive drum 31 is not disposed in a region from the downstream side area of the transferring roller 34 in the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 31 and the upstream side area of the development nip area in the rotational direction of the photosensitive drum 31. Therefore, the low-coat image forming apparatus 1 can be realized compared with other image forming apparatuses having the cleaning member. The present inventors have confirmed that the above effects are obtained under the following conditions. The contact area ratio of the development roller 331 is preferably set in a range of 4. 5% or more and 10% or less, more preferably a range of 6% or more and 8% or less. 14 is a view showing a state in which the contact area ratio of the development roller 331 is measured. As shown in 14, a triangular prism-shaped glass prism 80 having outer surfaces 801 and 802 which are disposed perpendicular to each other, and an outer surface 803 which is disposed so as to intersect with the outer surfaces 801 and 802 at 45 is prepared. That is, the prism 80 has a cross section of a right isosceles triangle. The development roller 331 is disposed such that the circumferential face of the development roller 331 is brought into contact with the outer surface 803 of the prism 80 at a contact line pressure of 1 N/m. Then, white light is emitted to the contact area between the circumferential face of the development roller 331 and the outer surface 803 through the outer surface 801 of the prism 80, and an image of the contact area between the circumferential face of the development roller 331 and the outer surface 803 projected on the outer surface 802 of the prism 80 may be photographed by a microscope. For example, a white LED light source IHM-25 manufactured by Raymac Corporation may be used as a light source for emitting the white light. For the microscope, a KH-8700 manufactured by HiROX can be used. The black region in the photographed image is a region where the white light emitted through the outer surface 801 of the prism 80 is absorbed because the circumferential face of the development roller 331 and the outer surface 803 of the prism 80 are actually in contact with each other. That is, the black region is considered to be a region of the circumferential face of the development roller 331 excluding the concave portion. In other words, the non-black region in the photographed image is a region where the circumferential face of the development roller 331 and the outer surface 803 of the prism 80 are not in contact with each other, and is considered to be a region of the concave portion in the circumferential peripheral face of the development roller 331. Therefore, the photographed image is subjected to a binarization process, and a ratio of the area of the black region to the area of the image after the binarization process =area of the black region/area of the image after the binarization process can be calculated as the contact area ratio of the circumferential face of the development roller 331. Further, when the regulating blade 334 is pressed against the surface of the development roller 331, the regulation pressure is preferably set within a range of 10 N/m or more and 60 N/m or less, and more preferably set within a range of 15 N/m or more and 25 N/m or less. The surface roughness of the development roller 331 may be set by covering it with a coating layer including powder, or by polishing a raw tube of the development roller 331, and the method is not limited to the above ways. The surface roughness Rz of the development roller 331 is preferably set to a range of 2 m or more and 4 m or less, the surface roughness Sm is preferably set to a range of 12 m or more and 290 m or less, and Sm/Rz is preferably set to a range of 30 or more and 145 or less. The above experiment is carried out in a condition where the average particle diameter of the used toner is 6. 8 m D50, and it is confirmed that the same results are obtained in a range of 6. 0 m or more and 8. 0 m or more. When the average particle diameter of the toner is selected from this range, the particle diameter smaller than 6. 0 m is not preferable because it leads to an increase in the manufacturing cost of the toner, and the particle diameter larger than 8. 0 m is not preferable because it leads to an increase in the toner consumption, which deteriorates the fixing ability, and in addition, deteriorates the image quality. The above experiment is carried out under a condition where the circularity of the toner is 0. 96, and it is confirmed that the same results are obtained in a range of 0. 93 or more and 0. 97 or less. The circularity less than 0. 93 is not preferable because the image quality tends to deteriorate. Further, the circularity more than 0. 97 is not preferable because the manufacturing cost is greatly increased. Further, for the circumferential speed difference between the photosensitive drum 31 and the development roller 331, it is confirmed that the same results are obtained in a range of 1. 1 or more and 1. 6 or less the surface speed of the development roller 331 is higher than that of the photosensitive drum 31. The circumferential speed difference smaller than 1. 1 is not preferable because toner fogging, in which the toner adheres to the white image portion, is generated. In addition, the circumferential difference larger than 1. 6 is not preferable from the viewpoint of the lifetime of the apparatus because the drive torque, vibration of the apparatus, and stress of the toner increase. In addition, it has been confirmed that the same results are obtained for each bias when the surface potential of the photosensitive drum 31 is within a range of 500 V or more and 800 V or less and the potential of the photosensitive drum 31 after exposed is within a range of 70 V or more and 200 V or less. In particular, when the surface free energy of the development roller 331 is low, in order to adhere the toner to the development roller 331 stably, the material of the supply roller 332 is preferably a foamed material for example, urethane foam rubber, the supply roller 332 preferably has an outer diameter equal to or larger than an outer diameter of the development roller 31, and the supply roller 331 rotates in the same direction as the development roller 331 =a counter direction at the nip area, in contact in the reverse direction. The biting amount between the development roller 331 and the supply roller 332 is preferably 0. 5 mm or more, more preferably within a range of 0. 5 mm or more and 1. 0 mm or less. If the biting amount is too smaller than 0. 5 mm, the supply amount tends to decrease, and if the biting amount is too large, the drive torque of the development device increases, and permanent deformation of the supply nip area due to long leaving tends to occur. The voltage applied to the supply roller 332 is preferably equal to or higher than the potential of the development roller 331. More preferably, a voltage of +100 V or more is applied to the development roller 331. As described above, when the PET film is held in the development nip area and the pulling force is measured, the toner on the photosensitive drum 31 and the development roller 331 is actually in contact with the PET film. It has been confirmed that the above effects are obtained when the toner carrying amount on the development roller 331 is within a range of at least 1 g/m2 or more and 10 g/m2 or less. If the toner carrying amount is less than 1 g/m2, the amount of the toner developed on the photosensitive drum 31 is too small, and the image density is too low. On the other hand, in the range of more than 10 g/m2, the consumed amount of the toner is large, the cost is increased, and the amount of the toner on the sheet is too large to heat-fix the toner on the sheet. Therefore, it is desirable to set it in the range of 1 g/m2 or more and 10 g/m2 or less. Further, the same evaluation result effect as described above was reproduced in a range in which the diameter of the development roller 331 is within a range of 11. 0 mm or more and 15. 0 mm or less. Similarly, the same evaluation result effect as described above was reproduced when the circumferential speed ratio of the development roller 331 to the supply roller 332 is within a range of 1. 3 or more and 1. 8 or less the circumferential speed of the development roller 331 is higher than that of the supply roller. Further, it has been confirmed that the surface roughness, the circumferential speed ratio of the development roller 331 to the supply roller 332 and the carrying amount of the toner on the development roller 331 do not significantly affect the above relational expression. Although the development device 33 according to the present embodiment and the image forming apparatus 1 including the development device 33 have been described above, the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and for example, the following modified embodiment can be employed. 1 In the above embodiment, the image forming apparatus 1 is provided with one development device 33, but the image forming apparatus 1 may be a color image forming apparatus having development devices 33 corresponding to a plurality of colors. 2 In the embodiment described above, the development housing 330 of the development device 33 stores the nonmagnetic toner therein, but the development device 33 may have a toner container and a toner cartridge for storing the nonmagnetic toner in addition to the development housing 330.",

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "As a developing device used for an image forming apparatus, the following configuration is used. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 2011-133768 discusses a developing device including a rotatable developing roller and a layer thickness regulating blade that contacts a peripheral surface of the developing roller. In the developing device discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 2011-133768, the layer thickness regulating blade is formed of a blade that regulates a layer thickness, and a support member that supports the blade. The blade and the support member are fixed by welding. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 2011-133768 discusses a configuration in which the blade and the support member are not welded at a blade end portion in a rotational axis direction of the developing roller. Regarding the configuration discussed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 2011-133768, if blade end portions are not welded in a welding range of the layer thickness regulating blade, a contact pressure at the blade end portions decreases and developer is more likely to leak from a developing frame. Developer leaking to the outside of the developing device may contaminate the developing device.",

Semiconductor memory devices may be classified into volatile memory devices, which lose data stored therein at power-off, such as a static random access memory SRAM, a dynamic RAM DRAM, and a synchronous DRAM, and nonvolatile memory devices, which retain data stored therein even at power-off, such as a read only memory ROM, a programmable ROM PROM, an electrically programmable ROM EPROM, an electrically erasable and programmable ROM EEPROM, a flash memory device, a phase-change RAM PRAM, a magnetic RAM MRAM, a resistive RAM RRAM, and a ferroelectric RAM FRAM. Flash memory devices are being widely used as mass storage in computing systems. A flash memory-based large-capacity storage medium uses a buffer memory, such as a DRAM or an SRAM, to compensate for a difference between a program speed of the flash memory device and an interfacing speed of the computing system. However, since the buffer memory occupies a large area of the storage medium, to increase the capacity of the buffer memory causes an increase in costs. Accordingly, there is a need for devices or methods for reducing the size of the buffer memory and improving the performance of the large-capacity storage medium.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "Below, Example embodiments of the inventive concepts may be described in detail and clearly to such an extent that one having ordinary skill in the art may easily implement the inventive concepts. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a user device, according to an example embodiment of the inventive concepts. Referring to 1, a user device 1000 may include a host 1010 and first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200.

The host 1010 may perform various arithmetic operations for driving various application programs of the user device 1000. In an example embodiment, the host 1010 may be an information processing device such as a central processing unit CPU or an application processor AP. The host 1010 may store data in the first or second storage device 1100 or 1200 or may read the stored data therefrom.

Under control of the second controller 1210, the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 may store data or may output the stored data. In an example embodiment, each of the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 1120 and 1220 may include a plurality of memory dies, a plurality of memory chips, or a plurality of memory packages. In an example embodiment, each of the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 1120 and 1220 may include a nonvolatile memory such as a NAND flash memory. However, Example embodiments of the inventive concepts are not limited thereto. For example, each of the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 1120 and 1220 may include a nonvolatile memory such as a ROM, a PROM, an EPROM, an EEPROM, a flash memory device, a PRAM, a MRAM, a RRAM, or a FRAM. In an example embodiment, the host 1010 may be directly connected with the first storage device 1100 to communicate therewith. For example, the host 1010 and the first storage device 1100 may directly communicate with each other through first ports PT01 and PT11. That is, the host 1010 may provide the first storage device 1100 with information, such as a command for controlling the first storage device 1100, control information, and write data, through the first ports PT01 and PT11, and the first storage device 1100 may provide the host 1010 with information, such as status information and read data, through the first ports PT01 and PT11. In an example embodiment, the second storage device 1200 may be indirectly connected with the host 1010 to communicate therewith. For example, as described above, the host 1010 and the first storage device 1100 may be directly connected with each other through the first ports PT01 and PT11. The second storage device 1200 may be directly connected with the first storage device 1100 through second ports PT12 and PT22. The host 1010 may provide the first storage device 1100 with information, such as a command for controlling the second storage device 1200, control information, and write data, through the first ports PT01 and PT11, and the first storage device 1100 may transmit the information provided from the host 1010 to the second storage device 1200 through the second ports PT12 and PT22. Likewise, the second storage device 1200 may provide the first storage device 1100 with information, such as status information and read data, through the second ports PT12 and PT22, and the first storage device 1100 may transmit the information received through the first ports PT12 and PT22 to the host 1010 through the second ports PT01 and PT11. That is, the first storage device 1100 may be configured to perform an information transfer role between the host 1010 and the second storage device 1200. As described above, the host 1010, the first storage device 1100, and the second storage device 1200 may be connected to each other in a chain structure or a cascade connection structure. In an example embodiment, the first storage device 1100 may be embedded storage, and the second storage device 1200 may be removable card storage. In an example embodiment, the above-described connection between the host 1010, the first storage device 1100, and the second storage device 1200 is an example, and example embodiments of the inventive concepts may not be limited thereto. In an example embodiment, the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 may respectively manage data stored in the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 1120 and 1220 based on first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2. For example, the first controller 1110 may manage data stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 based on the first mapping information MAP1. In an example embodiment, the first mapping information MAP1 may include sector conversion information, block management information, etc. that are associated with the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. The sector conversion information may include information about a correspondence relationship between a logical address of data stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 and a physical address of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120, at which the data are stored, garbage collection information of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120, wear leveling information of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120, etc. The block management information may include information about management of bad and free blocks of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. The second controller 1210 may manage data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 based on the second mapping information MAP2. The second mapping information MAP2 may include sector conversion information, block management information, etc. that are associated with the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. The sector conversion information included in the second mapping information MAP2 may include information about a correspondence relationship between a logical address of data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 and a physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, at which the data are stored, garbage collection information of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, wear leveling information of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, etc. The block management information included in the second mapping information MAP2 may include information about management of bad and free blocks of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. The second mapping information MAP2 may include information about a correspondence relationship between a logical address of data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 and a physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, at which the data are stored. In an example embodiment, the first storage device 1100 may receive the second mapping information MAP2 from the second storage device 1200. For ease of description, mapping information that is provided from the second storage device 1200 and is stored in the first controller 1110 is marked with MAP2. On the basis of the mapping information MAP2, the first storage device 1100 may store data in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 or may read data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. For example, the host 1010 may provide the first storage device 1100 with a first write command for storing data in the first storage device 1100 and first write data. The first write data received from the host 1010 may be temporarily stored in a data buffer not illustrated of the first controller 1110. An event that the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 of the first storage device 1100 is operating and an available capacity of the data buffer for storing next write data is insufficient may occur. In this case, the first controller 1110 cannot receive the next write data from the host 1010 until an operation of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is completed. That is, a write operation may be delayed due to a lack of capacity of the data buffer. In an example embodiment, the operation of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 may include operations such as a program operation, an erase operation, a read operation, and a garbage collection operation. In this case, the first controller 1110 may transmit or store the first write data stored in the data buffer to or in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, based on the second mapping information MAP2 from the second controller 1210. For example, the first controller 1110 may transmit first write data received from the host 1010 and a second write command to the second storage device 1200. In an example embodiment, the first write data may be data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 by a request of the host 1010, as described above. The second write command may be a write command for storing the first write data in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. In an example embodiment, the second write command may include a physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. As described above, when failing to program the received first write data in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120, the first storage device 1100 may transmit the first write data and a write command to the second storage device 1200 such that the received first write data is programmed in the second storage device 1200 or the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. According to the above-described operation, the first storage device 1100 may continue to receive write data from the host 1010 even if a capacity of the data buffer is insufficient or the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is operating. Accordingly, since a delay of the write operation is reduced, a storage device having improved performance is provided. In an example embodiment, the first write data stored in the second storage device 1200 may be moved to the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 under a specific condition and under control of the first storage device 1100. In an example embodiment, the specific condition may include at least one of conditions such as the case where the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 are at an idle state and the case where the size of first write data stored in the second storage device 1200 exceeds a given size. Although not illustrated in 1, the second storage device 1200 may receive the first mapping information MAP1 from the first storage device 1100 and may store write data to be stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 based on the received first mapping information MAP1. In an example embodiment, the first and second controllers 1110 and 1210 may exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other through the second ports PT12 and PT22. Alternatively, the first and second controllers 1110 and 1210 may exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other through a separate signal line or a separate data path. In an example embodiment, the exchanging of mapping information may be implemented by a separate hardware circuit or by software. 2 is a block diagram illustrating software layers of a user device of 1. Referring to 1 and 2, software layers of the user device 1000 may include an application 1011, a file system 1012, a first flash translation layer FTL1, and a second flash translation layer FTL2. The application 1011 may include an operating system or various application programs that are driven on the host 1010. The file system 1012 may organize files or data used by the application 1011 when storing the files or data in the first or second nonvolatile memory device 1120 or 1220. For example, the file system 1012 may manage storage areas of the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 by using logical addresses. The file system 1012 may allocate logical addresses to data to be stored in the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 for management. In an example embodiment, the file system 1012 may have a type that is variable with the operating system OS of the host 1010. In an example embodiment, the file system 1012 may include FAT File Allocation Table, FAT32, NTFS NT File System, HFS Hierarchical File System, JSF2 Journaled File System2, XFS, ODS-5 On-Disk Structure-5, UDF, ZFS, UFS Unix File System, ext2, ext3, ext4, ReiserFS, Reiser4, ISO 9660, Gnome VFS, BFS, WinFS, or the like. In an example embodiment, the application 1011 and the file system 1012 may be software layers driven on the host 1010. The first and second flash translation layers FTL1 and FTL2 provide interfaces between the host 1010 and the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 1120 and 1220 such that the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 1120 and 1220 are effectively used. For example, the first flash translation layer FTL1 may perform an operation of converting a logical address managed by the file system 1012 into a physical address of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. The second flash translation layer FTL2 may perform an operation of converting a logical address managed by the file system 1012 into a physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. In an example embodiment, the first and second flash translation layers FTL1 and FTL2 may respectively perform the above-described address conversion operation through the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2. In an example embodiment, the first flash translation layer FTL1 may perform the data exchange operation described with reference to 1, based on the second mapping information MAP2 from the second flash translation layer FTL2. For example, the first flash translation layer FTL1 may update the second mapping information MAP2 such that at least a portion of data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. In an example embodiment, the updated second mapping information MAP2 may be provided to the second controller 1210 through the second ports PT12 and PT22 described with reference to 1 or through a separate path. In an example embodiment, the first and second flash translation layers FTL1 and FTL2 may be software layers that are respectively driven in the first and second controllers 1110 and 1210. In an example embodiment, for ease of illustration, the file system 1012 is illustrated as being directly and independently connected with the first and second flash translation layers FTL1 and FTL2. However, example embodiments of the inventive concepts are not limited thereto. Each of the first and second flash translation layers FTL1 and FTL2 may be connected with software layers on the host 1010 in the cascade connection structure as described with reference to 1. 3 is block diagram illustrating a first controller of 1. In an example embodiment, the first controller 1110 will be described with reference to 3. However, the second controller 1210 may have a structure similar to that of the first controller 1110 of 3. Referring to 1 to 3, the first controller 1110 may include a processor 1111, a SRAM 1112, a ROM 1113, a host interface 1114, and a flash interface 1115. The processor 1111 may control overall operations of the first controller 1110. The SRAM 1112 may be used as a buffer memory, a cache memory, or a main memory of the first controller 1110. In an example embodiment, the SRAM 1112 may be used as a data buffer. The ROM 1113 may store a variety of information, which are needed for the first controller 1110 to operate, in the form of firmware. In an example embodiment, the first flash translation layer FTL1 may be stored in the SRAM 1112 and may be driven by the processor 1111. In an example embodiment, the first mapping information MAP1 and the second mapping information MAP2 may be stored in the SRAM 1112 and may be managed by the first flash translation layer FTL1. The first controller 1110 may communicate with the host 1010 and the second storage device 1200 through the host interface 1114. In an example embodiment, the host interface 1114 may be configured to perform the information transfer role described with reference to 1. The first controller 1110 may communicate with the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 through the flash interface 1115. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a first storage device of 1. Below, for ease of illustration and for ease of description, it is assumed that write data received from the host 1010 is write data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. That is, example embodiments of the inventive concepts will be described under the condition that the host 1010 stores write data in the first storage device 1100. However, example embodiments of the inventive concepts may not be limited thereto. For example, write data may be stored in the second storage device 1200 by an explicit request of the host 1010. Also, it may be well understood that the following operations are described with reference to the first storage device 1100 but may be performed by any other element , the first flash translation layer FTL1 or a physical layer or a logical layer included in the host interface 1114 of the first storage device 1100. Referring to 1 and 4, in operation S110, the first storage device 1100 may receive write data from the host 1010. For example, the first storage device 1100 may receive a write command indicating a write operation of the first storage device 1100 from the host 1010 and may receive write data to be stored in the first storage device 1100 in response to the received write command. In operation S120, the first storage device 1100 may determine whether programing is possible. For example, if the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is performing a program operation, it is impossible to store the write data in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 until the program operation being performed is completed. If to program is impossible, in operation S130, the first storage device 1100 may receive the second mapping information MAP2 from the second storage device 1200. For example, if to program is impossible, the first storage device 1100 may request the second mapping information MAP2 from the second storage device 1200 by using a vendor command, a reserved command, or a separate command combination. The second storage device 1200 may provide the second mapping information MAP2 to the first storage device 1100 in response to the received request. In operation S140, the first storage device 1100 may transmit the write data to the second storage device 1200 based on the second mapping information MAP2. For example, the first storage device 1100 may select a storage area, in which the write data is to be stored, of storage areas of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 based on the second mapping information MAP2. The first storage device 1100 may transmit a write command, which includes a physical address of the selected storage area, and the write data to the second storage device 1200. In an example embodiment, a storage area, in which the write data is to be stored, of storage areas of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 may be a physical area or a logical area that is predetermined. That is, some of the storage areas of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 may be in advance allocated to be used by the first storage device 1100. In an example embodiment, the second storage device 1200 may store the write data in a storage area corresponding to the physical address in response to the received write command. In an example embodiment, the first storage device 1100 may update the second mapping information MAP2 based on a physical address of the selected storage area and a logical address of the write data. In operation S150, the first storage device 1100 may receive the write data from the second storage device 1200 based on the second mapping information MAP2. For example, the second mapping information MAP2 may include information about a physical address of a storage area, in which the write data are stored, of the storage areas of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. The first storage device 1100 may read the write data from the second storage device 1200 based on the physical address information included in the second mapping information MAP2. In an example embodiment, for the above-described read operation, the first storage device 1100 may provide the second storage device 1200 with a read command, a flush command, or a specific command, in which the physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 is included. The second storage device 1200 may provide the first storage device 1100 with the write data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 in response to the received command. In an example embodiment, the write data provided to the first storage device 1100 may be invalidated on the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. In an example embodiment, operation S150 may be performed when a specific condition is satisfied. The specific condition may include the case in which the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 are at an idle state or the case in which an available space is present in the data buffer of the first storage device 1100 or is not less than a reference size. In operation S160, the first storage device 1100 may program the write data based on the first mapping information MAP1. For example, the first storage device 1100 may program the write data received from the second storage device 1200 in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 based on the first mapping information MAP1. The first storage device 1100 may update the first mapping information MAP1 based on a logical address of the write data and a physical address of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. In an example embodiment, if the determination result of operation S120 indicates that to program is possible, the first storage device 1100 may perform operation S160. That is, if the determination result of operation S120 indicates that to program is possible, the first storage device 1100 may program the write data received from the host 1010 in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. In an example embodiment, operation S130 may be omitted. For example, the first storage device 1100 and the second storage device 1200 may exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other periodically or randomly. In this case, the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 may have been stored in the first storage device 1100. That is, if the first storage device 1100 and the second storage device 1200 exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other periodically or randomly, operation S130 may be omitted. As described above, when the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is programmable, the first storage device 2100 may program write data received from the host 1010 in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120; when the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is not programmable, the first storage device 2100 may transmit the received write data to the second storage device 1200 based on the second mapping information MAP2 such that the received write data are stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. Accordingly, it may be possible to secure a capacity of the data buffer. According to the above description, since the first storage device 1100 receives next write data from the host 1010, it may be possible to prevent the write operation from being delayed due to a lack of capacity of the data buffer. 5 and 6 are drawings for describing an operation of 4. For a brief description, elements which are unnecessary to describe an operation of 4 are omitted. Also, it is assumed that first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 received from the host 1010 are write data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. Also, for ease of illustration, only mapping information associated with the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 are illustrated in 5 and 6. In addition, as described above, it is assumed that the first storage device 1100 receives the first and second write data DATA1 and DATA2 from the host 1010 through the first ports PT01 and PT11 and transmits and receives the second write data DATA2 to and from the second storage device 1200 through the second ports PT12 and PT22. Furthermore, as described above, it is assumed that the first storage device 1100 manages the second mapping information MAP2 from the second storage device 1200 and stores the second write data DATA2 in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 based on the second mapping information MAP2. However, example embodiments of the inventive concepts may not be limited thereto. For example, the example embodiments of the inventive concepts may be variously changed or modified without departing from the scope and spirit of the inventive concepts. Referring to 1 and 4 to 6, the user device 1000 includes the first storage device 1100 and the second storage device 1200. The first storage device 1100 may include the first controller 1110 and the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. The second storage device 1200 may include the second controller 1210 and the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. As illustrated in a first section of 5, the first controller 1110 may receive the first data DATA1 from the host 1010. The first data DATA1 may be data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 by a request of the host 1010. The first data DATA1 may correspond to a first logical address LA1. The received first data DATA1 may be temporarily stored in the data buffer , SRAM of the first controller 1110. For example, the first controller 1110 may program the first data DATA1 in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 based on the first mapping information MAP1. For example, the first controller 1110 may manage information about a correspondence relationship between a first physical address PA11 and the first logical address LA1, which correspond to the first data DATA1, as the first mapping information MAP1. The first physical address PA11 may be a physical address of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120, at which the first data DATA1 are stored. In an example embodiment, the operation illustrated in the first section of 5 may correspond to operation S110, operation S120, and operation S160 of 4. Next, as illustrated in a second section of 5, the first controller 1110 may receive the second data DATA2 from the host 1010. The second data DATA2 may be data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 by a request of the host 1010. The second data DATA2 may correspond to a second logical address LA2. The received second data DATA2 may be temporarily stored in the data buffer , SRAM of the first controller 1110. In an example embodiment, an event in which the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is performing a garbage collection operation, a program operation, a read operation, or an erase operation may occur, while the first controller 1110 temporarily stores the second data DATA2 in the data buffer. That is, an event in which the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is not at a programmable state may occur. In this case, as described above, the second data DATA2 has to be retained in the data buffer until an operation of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is completed. This situation may cause a write delay. In this case, the first controller 1110 may transmit the second data DATA2 to the second storage device 1200 based on the second mapping information MAP2. For example, the first controller 1110 may manage the second mapping information MAP2 received from the second storage device 1200. The first controller 1110 may transmit the second data DATA2 to the second controller 1210 of the second storage device 1200 such that the second data DATA2 are stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. In this case, the first controller 1110 may manage correspondence information between the second logical address LA2 and a second physical address PA21 as the second mapping information MAP2. The second physical address PA21 may be a physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, at which the second data DATA2 is to be stored. That is, the first controller 1110 may store the second data DATA2 in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 based on the second mapping information MAP2. In an example embodiment, the first controller 1110 may transmit a write command for storing the second data DATA2 in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 to the second controller 1210. The write command may include information of the second physical address PA21. The second controller 1210 may store the second data DATA2 in a storage area, which corresponds to the second physical address PA21, of storage areas of the second nonvolatile memory devices 1220 in response to the received command. In an example embodiment, the second mapping information MAP2 updated by the first controller 1110 may be provided to the second controller 1210, and the second controller 1210 may manage the updated second mapping information MAP2 as the second mapping information MAP2. In an example embodiment, the operation illustrated in the second section of 5 may correspond to operation S110, operation S120, and operation S140 of 4. In an example embodiment, since the second data DATA2 transmitted to the second storage device 1200 is released from the data buffer, an available capacity of the data buffer may be secured. And then, as illustrated in 6, the first storage device 1100 may read the second data DATA2 from the second storage device 1200 and may store the read second data DATA2 in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. The second data DATA2 indicates data that should be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 by a request of the host 1010 but are stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 under control of the first controller 1110. For example, the first storage device 1100 may read the second data DATA2 from the second storage device 1200 under a specific condition. The specific condition may include the following conditions: an idle state, the condition in which a capacity of the data buffer of the first controller 1110 is not less than a reference size, and the condition in which the size of the second data DATA2 is not less than a reference size. The first controller 1110 may recognize that the second data DATA2 has been stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, based on the second mapping information MPA2. On the basis of the second mapping information MAP2, the first controller 1110 may read the second data DATA2 from the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 and may store the second data DATA2 in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. The first controller 1110 may manage correspondence information between the second logical address LA2 and a third physical address PA13 of the second data DATA2 as the first mapping information MAP1. The third physical address PA13 may be a physical address of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120, at which the second data DATA2 are stored. The first controller 1110 may invalidate correspondence information between the second logical address LA2 and the second physical address PA21, which are included in the second mapping information MAP2. The second mapping information MAP2, in which correspondence information between the second logical address LA2 and the second physical address PA21 is invalidated, may be provided to the second controller 1210. The second controller 1210 may manage the second mapping information MAP2 based on the received information. As described above, when a write delay occurs, the first storage device 1100 may temporarily store write data received from the host 1010 in the second storage device 1200 based on the second mapping information MAP2 of the second storage device 1200. Afterwards, when a specific condition is satisfied, the write data temporarily stored in the second storage device 1200 may be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 of the first storage device 1100 under control of the first storage device 1100. Accordingly, since a write delay is prevented even at a situation in which write operations of the first storage device 1100 such as a program operation and a garbage collection operation can be delayed, a storage device having improved performance is provided. 7 is a flowchart illustrating another operation of a first storage device of 1. For the sake of brevity, a description of elements that are the same as those above described is omitted. Referring to 1 and 7, in operation S210, the first storage device 1100 may receive write data from the host 1010. The operation S210 is similar to the operation S110 of 4, and a detailed description thereof is thus omitted. In operation S220, the first storage device 1100 may transmit the received write data to the second storage device 1200 based on the second mapping information MAP2. In an example embodiment, since operation S220 is similar to operation S140 of 4, a detailed description thereof is thus omitted. In an example embodiment, unlike operation S140 of 4, operation S220 may be performed regardless of whether the first storage device 1100 is programmable. That is, even though the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is programmable, the first storage device 1100 may transmit the write data to the second storage device 1200. The second storage device 1200 may store the write data in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220. In operation S230, the first storage device 1100 may determine whether a specific condition is satisfied. For example, the first storage device 1100 may determine the size of data, which will be moved to the first nonvolatile memory device 1120, of data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, based on the second mapping information MAP2. That the determined size of data is not less than a reference size indicates that the specific condition is satisfied. In this case, the first storage device 1100 may perform operation S240. If the specific condition is not satisfied, the first storage device 1100 may not perform a separate operation. In operation S240, the first storage device 1100 may receive the write data from the second storage device 1200 based on the second mapping information MAP2. In operation S250, the first storage device 1100 may program the received write data in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 based on the first mapping information MAP1. Operation S240 and operation S250 are similar to operation S150 and operation S160 of 4, and a detailed description thereof is thus omitted. In an example embodiment, the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 may be a NAND flash memory. The NAND flash memory may read or program data in units of a page or a word line and may erase data in units of a memory block, a sub-block, or a super block. In an example embodiment, the size of write data received from the host 1010 may be smaller than an erase unit of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. Due to a physical characteristic of the NAND flash memory, the first controller 1110 may perform a maintenance operation such as garbage collection or wear leveling to use the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 efficiently. The maintenance operation may have an influence on the lifespan of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 because it is an operation of repeatedly performing a program, read, or erase operation on the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. In an example embodiment, in the case where segmentation of write data received from the host 1010 is reduced, the number of times of maintenance operations may decrease, thereby preventing the lifespan of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 from being shortened. In an example embodiment, according to the operating method of 7, it may be possible to reduce a decrease in lifespan due to the maintenance operation of a storage device such as the above-described garbage collection. For example, as described above, the first storage device 1100 is configured to first store write data received from the host 1010 in the second storage device 1200. When the size of write data stored in the second storage device 1200 is a predetermined size or larger, the first storage device 1100 may store the write data, which have been stored in the second storage device 1200, in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. In an example embodiment, the reference size may correspond to the size of a memory block included in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. That is, when write data to be stored in the first storage device 1100 is first stored in the second storage device 1200 and the size of write data stored in the second storage device 1200 reaches the size of a memory block, the write data stored in the second storage device 1200 may be stored or moved in or to the first storage device 1100. In this case, segmentation of write data may be prevented, and thus the lifespan of the first storage device 1100 may be prevented from being shortened due to the garbage collection or any other maintenance operation. According to the above-described example embodiments of the inventive concepts, the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 may exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other. The first storage device 1100 may determine whether to program is possible; if to program is impossible, the first storage device 1100 may store write data to be stored in the first storage device 1100 in the second storage device 1200. In this case, since a write delay due to factors such as a data buffer size of the first storage device 1100, garbage collection, and a program speed of the first nonvolatile memory device 1120 is reduced, a storage device of improved performance is provided. In addition, the first storage device 1100 may first store write data to be stored in the first storage device 1100 in the second storage device 1200, based on the second mapping information MAP2. Afterwards, when the size of write data stored or accumulated in the second storage device 1200 is a specific size or larger, the first storage device 1100 may store the write data, which have been stored or accumulated in the second storage device 1200, in the first nonvolatile memory device 1120. In this case, since segmentation of write data stored in the first storage device 1100 is reduced, the number of times of maintenance operations may decrease. This may mean that the lifespan of the first storage device 1100 is improved. 8 is a block diagram illustrating a user device, according to an example embodiment of the inventive concepts. Referring to 8, a user device 2000 may include a host 2010, a first storage device 2100, and a second storage device 2200. The first storage device 2100 may include a first controller 2110 and a first nonvolatile memory device 2120. The second storage device 2200 may include a second controller 2210 and a second nonvolatile memory device 2220. Since the host 2010, the first and second storage devices 2100 and 2200, the first and second controllers 2110 and 2210, and the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 2120 and 2220 are described with reference to 1, a detailed description thereof is thus omitted. Unlike the first and second controllers 1110 and 1210 of 1, the first and second controllers 2110 and 2210 of 8 may not exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other. Instead, the first controller 2110 may manage a logical address of write data stored in the second storage device 2200 by using a flush table FT. For example, the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 described with reference to 1 to 7 may exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other, and the first storage device 1100 may store write data in the second nonvolatile memory device 1220 based on the second mapping information MAP2. Unlike the above description, the first and second storage devices 2100 and 2200 of 8 may not exchange the first and second mapping information MAP1 and MAP2 with each other, and the first storage device 2100 may manage a logical address of write data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 based on the flush table FT. In this case, as described above, write data may be data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 by a request of the host 2010. During an idle time or when the size of write data stored in the second storage device 2200 is a reference size or larger, the first storage device 1100 may store the write data, which have been stored in the second storage device 2200, in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 based on the flush table FT. In an example embodiment, write data exchange between the first and second storage devices 1100 and 1200 described with reference to 1 to 7 may be performed with reference to a physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 1220, but write data exchange between the first and second storage devices 2100 and 2200 of 8 may be performed with reference to a logical address of write dataIn an example embodiment, the first storage device 2100 of 8 may transmit write data to the second storage device 2200 when to program is impossible, as described with reference to 4 to 6. Alternatively, as described with reference to 7, the first storage device 2100 of 8 may first store write data in the second storage device 2200 regardless of whether to program is possible and may store the write data stored in the second storage device 2200 in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 under a specific condition. As described above, the first storage device 2100 may manage a logical address of write data stored in the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 in more detail, data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 by using the flush table FT; on the basis of the flush table FT, the first storage device 2100 may store the write data in the second storage device 2200 or may move the write data stored in the second storage device 2200 to the first nonvolatile memory device 2120. 9 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a first storage device of 8. Referring to 8 and 9, in operation S310, the first storage device 2100 may receive write data from the host 2010. In operation S320, the first storage device 2100 may transmit the received write data to the second storage device 2200. In an example embodiment, the first storage device 2100 may transmit a write command, which includes a logical address corresponding to the received write data, to the second storage device 2200. The first storage device 2100 may manage a logical address included in the write command transmitted to the second storage device 2200 by using the flush table FT. In an example embodiment, the second storage device 2200 may store the received write data in the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 in response to the received write command and may manage correspondence information between the logical address included in the write command and a physical address of the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 as the second mapping information MAP2. In operation S330, the first storage device 2100 may transmit a flush request to the second storage device 2200 based on the flush table FT. For example, the flush table FT may include information about a logical address of data, which are stored in the second storage device 2200, of data to be stored in the first storage device 2100. The first storage device 2100 may transmit the flush request and the logical address to the second storage device 2200 to store write data corresponding to the logical address included in the flush table FT in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120. In an example embodiment, the flush request may be a command predefined by a communication protocol between the first and second storage devices 2100 and 2200, a vendor command, a reserved command, a read command, or any combination thereof. In operation S340, the first storage device 2100 may receive the write data from the second storage device 2200. For example, the second storage device 2200 may transmit write data corresponding to the received logical address to the first storage device 2100 in response to the flush request from the first storage device 2100. In an example embodiment, the write data transmitted to the first storage device 2100 may be invalidated in the second nonvolatile memory device 2220. In other words, the second controller 2210 of the second storage device 2200 may delete or invalidate information, which corresponds to a logical address of write data transmitted to the first storage device 2100, from the second mapping information MAP2. In operation S350, the first storage device 2100 may program the received write data in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120. The first storage device 2100 may manage information about a correspondence relationship between the logical address of the write data and a physical address of the first nonvolatile memory device 2120, as the first mapping information MAP1. In an example embodiment, information about the logical address of the write data programmed in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 may be deleted or invalidated from the flush table FT. In an example embodiment, operation S320 may be performed according to whether the first storage device 2100 is programmable. For example, as described with reference to operation S120 of 4, operation S320 may be performed when to program is impossible in the first storage device 2100 due to an operation of the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 or any other maintenance operation , garbage collection. In an example embodiment, operation S330 may be performed when a specific condition is satisfied. For example, the first storage device 2100 may perform operation S330 when the size of write data stored in the second storage device 2200 in more detail, data, which are stored in the second storage device 2200, of data to be stored in the first storage device 2100 is a reference size or larger or when the first and second storage devices 2100 and 2200 are an idle state. 10 is a drawing for describing an operation of 9. For the sake of brevity and for ease of description, elements that are unnecessary to describe an operation of 9 are omitted. Also, it is assumed that first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 received from the host 2010 respectively correspond to first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 and are data to be stored in the first storage device 2100. However, example embodiments of the inventive concepts may not be limited thereto. Referring to 8 to 10, the user device 2000 may include the first and second storage devices 2100 and 2200. The first storage device 2100 may include the first controller 2110 and the first nonvolatile memory device 2120, and the second storage device 2200 may include the second controller 2210 and the second nonvolatile memory device 2220. As illustrated in a first section of 10, the first controller 2110 may receive the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 from the host 2010. The first controller 2110 may provide the received first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 to the second controller 2210. The first controller 2110 may manage the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 of the transmitted first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 by using the flush table FT. The second controller 2210 may store the received first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 in the second nonvolatile memory device 2220. The second controller 2210 may manage correspondence information between the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 and first and second physical addresses PA21 and PA22 as the second mapping information MAP2. The first and second physical addresses PA21 and PA22 may be physical addresses of the second nonvolatile memory device 2220, at which the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 are stored. The first controller 2110 may recognize that the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 respectively corresponding to the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 are stored in the second storage device 2200, based on the flush table FT. In this case, as illustrated in a second section of 10, the first controller 2110 may receive the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 from the second controller 2210 and may store the received first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120. For example, the first controller 2110 may provide a flush request including the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 to the second controller 2210, based on the flush table FT. In response to the received flush request, the second controller 2210 may read the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2, which correspond to the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2, from the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 based on the second mapping information MAP2 and may transmit the read first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 to the first controller 2110. The first controller 2110 may store the received first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120. In an example embodiment, the second controller 2210 may transmit the first and second data DATA1 and DATA to the first controller 2110 in response to the flush request and may then delete or invalidate correspondence information of the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 and the first and second physical addresses PA21 and PA22 from the second mapping information MAP2. In an example embodiment, after storing the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120, the first controller 2110 may delete or invalidate information of the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 from the flush table FT and may manage correspondence information between the first and second logical addresses LA1 and LA2 and third and fourth physical addresses PA11 and PA12 as the first mapping information MAP1. The third and fourth physical addresses PA11 and PA12 may be physical addresses of the first nonvolatile memory device 2120, at which the first and second data DATA1 and DATA2 are stored. As described above, a first storage device according to an example embodiment of the inventive concepts may store write data received from a host in a second storage device based on second mapping information and may then store the write data stored in the second storage device in a first nonvolatile memory device. In this case, the first and second storage devices may exchange first and second mapping information with each other, and the first storage device may perform the above-described data transfer operation based on the second mapping information. Alternatively, the first storage device may perform the above-described data transfer operation by separately managing a logical address of write data transmitted to the second storage device, such as a flush table. In addition, if a write delay is occurred due to physical characteristics a program speed, garbage collection, of the first nonvolatile memory device, the first storage device may secure an available space of a data buffer by transmitting the write data to the second storage device, thereby making it possible to continue to receive next write data. That is, since the write delay is reduced, the performance of a storage device may be improved. Furthermore, the first storage device may first store the received write data in the second storage device; when the size of the write data stored in the second storage device is a reference size or larger, the first storage device may store the write data in the first nonvolatile memory. Accordingly, it may be possible to reduce a maintenance operation due to a physical characteristic a physical characteristic such as a difference between a read/write unit and an erase unit. This may mean that the lifespan of the storage device is improved. In an example embodiment, the example embodiments of the inventive concepts are described with reference to a write operation of the first storage device. However, example embodiments of the inventive concepts may not be limited thereto. For example, the second storage device may also perform an operation that is based on the above-described example embodiments. 11 is a block diagram for describing another example embodiment of a user device of 8. For a brief description, elements which are unnecessary to describe an operation of the user device 2000 are omitted. In an example embodiment, the first storage device 1100/2100 described with reference to 1 to 10 may be configured to store write data to be stored in the first storage device 1100/2100 in the second storage device 1200/2200 by using the second mapping information MAP2 of the second storage device 1200/2200 or the flush table FT. Unlike the above description, referring to 8 and 11, in an example embodiment of 11, a portion of a storage area of the second storage device 2200 may be pre-allocated as a storage area for the first storage device 2100. The pre-allocated storage area may be managed by the first mapping information MAP1 of the first storage device 2100. As a more detailed example, it is assumed that each of the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 2120 and 2220 has a storage capacity of 64 gigabytes GB. In this case, in the example embodiment described with reference to 1 to 10, storage spaces of the first and second storage devices may be respectively recognized by a host as being 64 GB. Unlike the example embodiment described with reference to 1 to 10, in the example embodiment of 11, a portion , 16 GB of the storage area of the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 may be allocated to the first storage device 2100, and the first storage device 2100 may manage the allocated area , 16 GB of the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 and the storage area , 64 GB of the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 by using the first mapping information MAP1. Consequently, the storage space of the first storage device 2100 may be recognized by the host 2010 as being 80 GB, and the storage space of the second storage device 2200 may be recognized by the host 2010 as being 48 GB. In an example embodiment, the area allocated from the second storage device 2200 may be used for the operation described with reference to 1 to 10. For example, the first storage device 2100 may store write data to be stored in the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 in the allocated area of the storage area of the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 and may manage write operation for write data or information about an area, in which the write data is stored, through the first mapping information MAP1. In an example embodiment, the area allocating operation described with reference to 11 may be performed upon booting of the user device 200. For example, when the user device 2000 is booted, the above-described area allocating operation may be performed by firmware of the first and second storage devices 2100 and 2200. Alternatively, the above-described area allocating operation may be performed by an explicit request of the host 2010 upon booting of the user device 2000. In an example embodiment, an area of the second storage device 2200 allocated to the first storage device 2100 may be an area that is not recognized by the host 2010. For example, as described above, each of the first and second nonvolatile memory devices 2120 and 2220 may have a storage capacity of 64 GB, and 16 GB of the storage capacity of the second nonvolatile memory device 2220 may be allocated to the first storage device 2100. In this case, the first storage device 2100 may manage the first nonvolatile memory device 2120 and the allocated storage area based on the first mapping information MAP1, but a storage space of the first storage device 2100 recognized by the host 2010 may be 64 GB i. e. , the storage capacity of the first nonvolatile memory device 2120, and a storage space of the second storage device 2200 recognized by the host 2010 may be 48 GB. In this case, the allocated area i. e. , 16 GB may not be recognized by the host 2010 but may be used as a dedicated space for temporarily storing write data as described above. 12 is a block diagram illustrating an interface protocol applicable to a user device, according to an example embodiment of the inventive concepts. Referring to 12, a user device 3000 may include a host 3010 and first and second storage devices 3100 and 3200. In an example embodiment, elements illustrated in 11 are to describe physical layers or logical layers complying with a communication interface between the host 3010 and the first and second storage devices 3100 and 3200, and elements that are unnecessary to describe the physical layers or logical layers are omitted. In an example embodiment, the user device 3000 illustrated in 11 may communicate in compliance with a universal flash storage UFS interface protocol. For example, the host 3010 may include an M-PHY layer L1#0, a PHY adapter layer L1. 5#0, a data link layer L2#0, a network layer L3#0, a transport layer L4#0, and an application/HCI Host Controller Interface layer LA#0 hereinafter referred to as an application layer. Each layer of the host 3010 may include a physical hardware circuit and/or a program code executable by a processor core to perform one's own functions. The first storage device 3100 may include M-PHY layers L1#1a and L1#1b, PHY adapter layers L1. 5#1a and L1. 5#1b, data line layers L2#1a and L2#1b, network layers L3#1a and L3#1b, transport layers L4#1a and L4#b, and an application/UTP UFS Transport Protocol layer LA#1 hereinafter referred to as an application layer. All or some of the layers of the first storage device 3100 may be included in the first controller 1110 or 2110 of 1 or 8 or the host interface 1114 of 3. The second storage device 3200 may include an M-PHY layer L1#2, a PHY adapter layer L1. 5#2, a data link layer L2#2, a network layer L3#2, a transport layer L4#2, and an application/UTP layer LA#2. The layers of the second storage device 3200 may be included in the second controller 1210 or 2210. Each of the layers of the first and second storage devices 3100 and 3200 may include a physical hardware circuit and/or a program code executable by a processor core to perform one's own functions. Each of the M-PHY layers L1#0 to L1#2 may include a communication circuit to send and receive a packet. The M-PHY layer L1#0 of the host 3010 may exchange a packet with the M-PHY layer L1#1a of the first storage device 3100 through the first ports PT01 and PT11, and the M-PHY layer L1#1b of the first storage device 3100 may exchange a packet with the M-PHY layer L1#2 of the second storage device 3200 through the second ports PT12 and PT22. For example, each of the M-PHY layers L1#0, L1#1a, L1#1b, and L1#2 may be a physical layer and may be implemented according to the M-PHY protocol proposed by the MIPI alliance. The PHY adapter layers L1. 5#0 to L1. 5#2 may manage communication environments of the M-PHY layers L1#0 to L1#2, respectively. For example, the PHY adapter layers L1. 5#0 to L1. 5#2 may process data symbols or may control electric power, for the respective M-PHY layers L1#0 to L1#2. Each of the data link layers L2#0 to L2#2 may manage physical transmission and composition of data. Each of the network layers L3#0 to L3#2 may manage a communication path or may handle communication timing. Each of the transport layers L4#0 to L4#2 may detect an error of data and may recover erroneous data. Accordingly, the PHY adapter layers L1. 5#0 to L1. 5#2, the data link layers L2#0 to L2#2, the network layers L3#0 to L3#2, and the transport layers L4#0 to and L4#2 may perform packet transmission and conversion through the M-PHY layers L1#0 to L1#2. For example, the PHY adapter layers L1. 5#0 to L1. 5#2, the data link layers L2#0 to L2#2, the network layers L3#0 to L3#2, and the transport layers L4#0 to L4#2 may be implemented according to the UniPro protocol supported by the MIPI alliance as a link layer. The application layers LA#0 to LA#2, which are upper layers, may handle a request from the user of the host 3010 and the first and second storage devices 3100 and 3200. In an example embodiment, the M-PHY layers L1#0 to L1#2, the PHY adapter layers L1. 5#0 to L1. 5#2, the data link layers L2#0 to L2#2, the network layers L3#0 to L3#2, and the transport layers L4#0 to L4#2, which are lower layers, may communicate with an external device for the application layers LA#0 to LA#2. Communications between respective layers may be based on packets having different data formats. For example, a data format of a packet exchanged between the application layers LA#0 and LA#1 may be different from a data format of a packet exchanged between the PHY adapter layers L1. 5#0 and L1. 5#1a. For example, a data format of a packet exchanged between the data link layers L2#1b and L2#2 may be different from a data format of a packet exchanged between the transport layers L4#1b and L4#2. In an example embodiment, each of the application layers LA#0, LA#1, and LA#2 may convey and process a packet having a UFS protocol information unit UPIU format. 13 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a user device of 12. In an example embodiment, the user device 3000 of 12 operates according to the UFS interface protocol, and an operation that is based on the flowchart of 13 illustrates an operating method that complies with the UFS interface protocol. Below, it is assumed that information exchanged between the host 3010 and the first storage device 3100 and information exchanged between the first and second storage devices 3100 and 3200 are exchanged in the form of packet. The packet form may correspond to a packet having the UPIU format as described above. Referring to 12 and 13, in operation S3101, the host 3010 may transmit a first write command to the first storage device 3100. In an example embodiment, the first write command may indicate a write request associated with the first storage device 3100. In operation S3102, the first storage device 3100 may transmit a ready to transfer RTT packet to the host 3010 in response to the first write command. In operation S3103, the host 3010 may transmit a data-output DOUT packet to the first storage device 3100 in response to the RTT packet. The DOUT packet may include at least a portion of write data to be stored in the first storage device 3100. In an example embodiment, write data may be transmitted from the host 3010 to the first storage device 3100 by repeating operation S3102 and operation S3103. In an example embodiment, the first storage device 3100 may temporarily store the write data, which are included in the DOUT packet received from the host 3010, in a data buffer. The first storage device 3100 may store the write data of the data buffer in a nonvolatile memory device included in the first storage device 3100 or may transmit the write data of the data buffer to the second storage device 3200. In an example embodiment, the above-described transmission of write data may be similar to transmission of write data from the first storage device to the second storage device described with reference to 1 to 11. That is, write data may be transmitted to the second storage device 3200 to improve the lifespan of the first storage device 3100, or for the improvement of write performance, write data may be transmitted to the second storage device 3200 based on whether a nonvolatile memory device is programmable. For example, in operation S3201, the first storage device 3100 may transmit a second write command to the second storage device 3200. The second write command may not be a write command corresponding to a request of the host 3010, but it may be a write command for storing write data in the second storage device 3200 to improve the lifespan or performance of the first storage device 3100. In operation S3202, the second storage device 3200 may transmit the RTT packet to the first storage device 3100 in response to the second write command. In operation S3203, the first storage device 3100 may transmit the DOUT packet, in which the write data are included, to the second storage device 3200 in response to the RTT packet. In an example embodiment, the write data of operation S3203 may be write data that is stored in the data buffer of the first storage device 3100. If the write data stored in the data buffer of the first storage device 3100 are transmitted to the second storage device 3200 through the DOUT packet, the write data stored in the data buffer of the first storage device 3100 may be regarded as being stored, and thus a capacity of the data buffer may be secured. In an example embodiment, write data may be transmitted from the first storage device 3100 to the second storage device 3200 by repeating operation S3202 and operation S3203. In operation S3206, the second storage device 3200 may transmit a response to the first storage device 3100. The response of operation S3206 may be a response to the second write command of operation S3201. For example, the second storage device 3200 may transmit the response to the second write command to the first storage device 3100 when all write data associated with the second write command are received. In operation S3106, the first storage device 3100 may transmit a response to the host 3010. The response of operation S3106 may be a response to the first write command of operation S3101. For example, the first storage device 3100 may transmit the response to the first write command to the host 3010 when all write data associated with the first write command are received. Afterwards, in operation S3301, the first storage device 3100 may transmit a flush command to the second storage device 3200. The flush command may be a command for storing write data, which are stored in the second storage device 3200, of write data to be stored in the first storage device 3100 in the first storage device 3100. In operation S3302, the second storage device 3200 may transmit a data-in DIN packet including write data to be stored in the first storage device 3100 to the first storage device 3100 in response to the flush command. In an example embodiment, operation S3302 may be repeated. In an example embodiment, the first storage device 3100 may store the write data included in the received DIN packet in a nonvolatile memory device included in the first storage device 3100. If all the write data associated with the flush command are transmitted to the first storage device 3100, in operation S3303, the second storage device 3200 may transmit a response to the first storage device 3100. In an example embodiment, the flowchart illustrated in 13 is a flowchart for describing some example embodiments of the inventive concepts. However, example embodiments of the inventive concepts may not be limited thereto. For example, operations illustrated in 13 may be performed to be overlapped and may not be limited to a sequence illustrated in 13. Also, operation S3201 to operation S3206 may be repeatedly performed at least twice or more while operation S3101 to operation S3106 are performed a write data transfer operation corresponding to one write command is performed. That is, the first storage device 3100 may issue the second write command twice or more, based on whether to program is possible. Also, an operation of transmitting write data from the second storage device 3200 to the first storage device 3100 may not be limited to an operation in which the second storage device 3200 transmits the DIN packet to the first storage device 3100 in response to the flush command. For example, to receive write data from the second storage device 3200, the first storage device 3100 may transmit the RTT packet to the second storage device 3200, and the second storage device 3200 may transmit the DOUT packet to the first storage device 3100 in response to the RTT packet. 14 is a block diagram illustrating a user device 4000 including serially connected storage devices, according to an example embodiment of the inventive concepts. Referring to 14, the user device 4000 may include a host 4010 and a plurality of storage devices 4101 to 410n connected in serial with the host 4010. In an example embodiment, each of the storage devices 4101 to 410n may be a first or second storage device described with reference to 1 to 13. The storage devices 4101 to 410n may be serially connected to each other through input/output ports thereof. Each of the storage devices 4101 to 410n may be directly connected with a storage devices adjacent thereto and may be indirectly connected with the remaining storage devices other than the directly connected storage devices. For example, the first storage device 4101 may be directly connected with the second storage device 4102 and may be indirectly connected with the n-th storage device 410n. In other words, the first storage device 4101 may be connected with the n-th storage device 410n through the second to n1-th storage devices 4102 to 410n1. According to the above description, the plurality of storage devices 4101 to 410n may be connected to each other in the chain structure. In an example embodiment, each of the plurality of storage devices 4101 to 410n may operate according to an operating method described with reference to 1 to 12. According to an example embodiment of the inventive concepts, a storage device may store write data received from a host in another storage device to improve write performance and lifespan. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a storage device having improved performance and lifespan, a user device including the storage device, and an operating method of the user device.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to the field of wireless communications and, in particular, to a method for device to device D2D communication, a terminal device, and a network device.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Internet of Vehicles that may also be called Vehicle to Everything V2X communication system is a sidelink SL transmission technology based on D2D communication. Different from the traditional way of receiving or transmitting data through a base station in a Long Term Evolution LTE system, the Internet of Vehicles system adopts a manner of terminal to terminal direct communication, thus having higher spectrum efficiency and lower transmission delay. In the version of Release-14 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP protocol, two transmission modes mode 3 and mode 4 are defined for the Internet of Vehicles. A terminal device using the transmission mode 3 and a terminal device using the transmission mode 4 transmit data in different resource pools. A resource used by the terminal using the mode 3 is allocated by a base station, and the terminal transmits data on the sidelink according to the resource allocated by the base station; while the terminal using the mode 4 can independently select a transmission resource of the sidelink, for example, the terminal can randomly select a resource on the sidelink or can determine a resource by sensing. Since the terminal device using the transmission mode 3 is connected with the base station, and its transmission resource is allocated by the base station, when the terminal device using the transmission mode 3 and the terminal device using the transmission mode 4 coexist, it is more necessary to protect the transmission reliability of the terminal device using the transmission mode 3. For a terminal that supports the new version of Release-15 of the 3GPP protocol, these two transmission modes can also be used. Moreover, the terminal device under each of the two versions may be a terminal device having a sensing capability, or may be a terminal device having no sensing capability. In this way, since the terminal device having no sensing capability cannot know the resource usage of other terminal devices, it is likely to interfere with the data transmission of the terminal device using the transmission mode 3. Therefore, how to enable different types of terminal devices to transmit data together in a communication system and reduce mutual interference is an urgent problem to be solved.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "The technical solutions in embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the technical solutions of the embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied to various communication systems, such as a Global System of Mobile Communication GSM system, a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA system, a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access WCDMA system, a Long Term Evolution LTE system, an LTE Frequency Division Duplex FDD system, an LTE Time Division Duplex TDD system, a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS, and a future 5G communication system.

The terminal device may also refer to a user equipment UE, an access terminal, a subscriber unit, a subscriber station, a mobile station, a mobile radio station, a remote station, a remote terminal, a mobile device, a user terminal, a terminal, a wireless communication device, a user agent or a user device.

In an embodiment, the wireless communication system may include a plurality of network devices and other numbers of terminal devices may be included within the coverage of each network device, which will not be limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure. In addition, the wireless communication system may further include other network entities such as a Mobile Management Entity MME, a Serving Gateway S-GW, and a Packet Data Network Gateway P-GW, while the embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. Specifically, a terminal device 20 and a terminal device 30 can communicate in a D2D communication mode. When performing a D2D communication, the terminal device 20 and the terminal device 30 communicate directly with each other via a D2D link, that is, a sidelink SL. For example, as shown in 1 or 2, the terminal device 20 and the terminal device 30 communicate directly with each other via a sidelink. In 1, the terminal device 20 and the terminal device 30 communicate with each other via the sidelink, and the transmission resource thereof is allocated by a network device; in 2, the terminal device 20 and the terminal device 30 communicate with each other via the sidelink, the transmission resource thereof is independently selected by the terminal device, and the network device is not required to allocate the transmission resource. The D2D communication may refer to Vehicle to Vehicle V2V communication or Vehicle to Everything V2X communication. In the V2X communication, X may refer to any device with wireless receiving and transmitting capabilities, such as, but not limited to, a slowly moving wireless device, a fast moving in-vehicle device, or a network control node with wireless transmitting and receiving capabilities. It should be understood that the embodiments of the present disclosure are mainly applied to the scenario of V2X communication, but may also be applied to any other D2D communication scenario, which will not be limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure. In an Internet of Vehicles system, there may be two types of terminal devices, that is, a terminal device having a sensing capability such as a Vehicle User Equipment VUE or a Pedestrian User Equipment PUE, and a terminal device that does not have a sensing capability such as a PUE. The VUE has higher processing capability and is usually powered by a battery in a vehicle, while the PUE has lower processing capability, and power consumption reduction is also a major factor that needs to be considered for the PUE. Therefore, in an existing Internet of Vehicles system, the VUE is considered to have full receiving and sensing capabilities; while the PUE is considered to have partial or no receiving and sensing capabilities. If the PUE has partial sensing capability, the resource may be selected using a similar sensing method as the VUE, and available resource may be selected on the part of the resources that can be sensed; if the PUE does not have the sensing capability, the PUE randomly selects the transmission resource in a resource pool. In the version of Release-14 of the 3GPP protocol, two transmission modes are defined, namely transmission mode 3 mode 3 and transmission mode 4 mode 4. The transmission resource of a terminal device using the transmission mode 3 is allocated by a base station, and the terminal device transmits data on the sidelink according to the resource allocated by the base station; the base station can allocate resource for single transmission to the terminal device, or can also allocate resource for semi-static transmission to the terminal device. If the terminal device using the transmission mode 4 has a sensing capability, data is transmitted by means of sensing and reservation; if there is no sensing capability, the transmission resource is randomly selected in a resource pool. The terminal device having the sensing capability acquires an available resource set by means of sensing in the resource pool, and the terminal device randomly selects one resource from the set for data transmission. Since the services in the Internet of Vehicles system have the feature of periodicity, the terminal device usually adopts the semi-static transmission mode, that is, after selecting one transmission resource, the terminal device continuously uses the resource in multiple transmission cycles, thereby reducing the probability of resource reselection and resource conflicts. The terminal device will carry information on the reserved resource for the next transmission in control information of the current transmission, so that other terminal devices can determine whether the resource is reserved and used by the terminal device by detecting the control information of the terminal device, thereby achieving the purpose of reducing the resource conflicts. Since the resource under the transmission mode 3 is scheduled by the base station and the resource pool under the transmission mode 4 is pre-configured or configured by the base station, there is no overlap of the resource pools for these two modes, that is, the resource pools corresponding to the transmission mode 3 and the transmission mode 4 are separated or do not overlap. The terminal device using the mode 3 transmits data on a time-frequency resource in a resource pool supporting the mode 3, and the terminal device using the mode 4 transmits data on a time-frequency resource in a resource pool supporting the mode 4. For a terminal device supporting a communication protocol of the new version of Release-15 of the 3GPP protocol, two transmission modes such as the transmission mode 3 and the transmission mode 4 described above are also supported. When the terminal device with the version of Release-15 and the terminal device with the version of Release-14 transmit data together in a communication system, the terminal device having a sensing capability can select the resource through resource sensing, but it is difficult for the terminal device having no sensing capability to avoid interference with data transmission of other terminal devices. Since the terminal device using the transmission mode 3 is connected with the base station and its transmission resource is allocated by the base station, when the terminal device using the transmission mode 3 and the terminal device using the transmission mode 4 coexist, it is more necessary to protect the transmission reliability of the terminal device using the transmission mode 3. Using the embodiments of the present disclosure, different resource pools are obtained for different types of terminal devices by dividing, and the relationships between the resource pools are coordinated reasonably, so that the different types of terminal devices transmit data together in the communication system and mutual interference is reduced. At least one of the following information of the different types of terminal devices is different: the supported version of the protocol, the transmission mode in use, and whether or not there is the sensing capability. 3 is a schematic flowchart of a method for D2D communication according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method shown in 3 may be performed by a terminal device, which may be, for example, the terminal device 20 or the terminal device 30 shown in 1. As shown in 3, the method for D2D communication includes:in 310, a terminal device determines a resource pool for data transmission from a plurality of resource pools according to a transmission mode used by the terminal device and whether the terminal device has a sensing capability. Different resource pools in the plurality of resource pools are used for data transmission by different types of terminal devices, and at least one of the following information of the different types of terminal devices is different: a transmission mode in use, a supported version of a communication protocol, and whether or not there is the sensing capability. The terminal device may be, for example, a pedestrian user equipment PUE or a vehicle user equipment VUE. In 320, the terminal device performs data transmission using a time-frequency resource in the resource pool. Specifically, when terminal devices supporting different communication protocols transmit data together in a communication system, the terminal device having a sensing capability can select the resource through resource sensing, but it is difficult for the terminal device having no sensing capability to avoid interference with data transmission of other terminal devices. The terminal devices supporting different communication protocols determine respective resource pools for data transmission from a plurality of resource pools according to transmission modes used by the terminal devices and whether the terminal devices have a sensing capability. The plurality of resource pools may be configured by a network device, or agreed by the network device and the terminal device in advance, for example, as specified in the protocol. The different resource pools in the plurality of resource pools are used for data transmission by different types of terminal devices, and at least one of the following information of the different types of terminal devices is different: the transmission mode in use, the supported version of the communication protocol, and whether or not there is the sensing capability. Since not only the transmission mode used by the terminal device is considered, but also the version of the communication protocol supported by the terminal device as well as whether the terminal device has the sensing capability are considered when the resource pools are obtained by dividing, the interference of the data transmission among different types of terminal devices is reduced as much as possible. The embodiments of the present disclosure provide two manners for obtaining resource pools by dividing, and details will be described below with reference to 4 and 5. Manner 1The terminal device having the sensing capability and the terminal device having no sensing capability do not share a resource pool. 1 If the terminal device supports the communication protocol of the version of Release-14 Rel-14 and does not support the communication protocol of the version of Release-15 Rel-15, the terminal device determines the resource pool for data transmission by the terminal device, including:if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and does not have the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is a first resource pool;if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and has the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is a second resource pool, where the second resource pool does not overlap the first resource pool;if the terminal device uses the first transmission mode, determining that the resource pool is a third resource pool, where the third resource pool does not overlap the first resource pool, and the third resource pool does not overlap the second resource pool. In an embodiment, the first resource pool includes a first sub-resource pool and a second sub-resource pool, where the terminal device determines that the resource pool is the first resource pool, including: if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and has the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is the first sub-resource pool in the first resource pool. 2 If the terminal device supports the communication protocol of the version of Release-15, the terminal device determines the resource pool for data transmission by the terminal device, including:if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and does not have the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is the first resource pool;if the terminal device supports the first transmission mode, or if the terminal device supports the second transmission mode and has the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is a fourth resource pool, and the fourth resource pool does not overlap the first resource pool. In an embodiment, the terminal device determines that the resource pool is the first resource pool, including: if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and does not have the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is the second sub-resource pool in the first resource pool. In an embodiment, in the Manner 1, the fourth resource pool described above may include the second resource pool and/or the third resource pool. For example, as the schematic diagram of resource pool division shown in 4, the plurality of resource pools in 4 include the first resource pool, the second resource pool, the third resource pool and the fourth resource pool. The first resource pool, the second resource pool and the third resource pool do not overlap each other, and the fourth resource pool does not overlap the first resource pool. Each of the resource pools is used for data transmission by a corresponding type of terminal devices. Table 1 shows the types of terminal devices corresponding to the different resource pools. TABLE 1 Resource Pool Type of the Terminal Device The first The first Support the version of Release-14, do not support the version resource sub-resource pool of Release-15, use the second transmission mode, and do not pool have the sensing capability The second Support the version of Release-15, use the second sub-resource pool transmission mode, and do not have the sensing capability The second resource pool Support the version of Release-14, do not support the version of Release-15, use the second transmission mode, and have the sensing capability The third resource pool Support the version of Release-14, do not support the version of Release-15, and use the first transmission mode The fourth resource pool Support the version of Release-15, and use the first transmission mode Support the version of Release-15, use the second transmission mode, and have the sensing capabilityThe fourth resource pool may include the second resource pool and/or the third resource pool, that is, the range of the fourth resource pool may be greater than the range of the second resource pool and/or the third resource pool. It should be understood that the fourth resource pool may include the second resource pool and/or the third resource pool, or the second resource pool may include the fourth resource pool, or the third resource pool may include the fourth resource pool. The size and location relationship between the second resource pool and the fourth resource pool and the size and location relationship between the third resource pool and the fourth resource pool are not limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure, as long as the first resource pool, the second resource pool and the third resource pool do not overlap each other, and the fourth resource pool and the first resource pool do not overlap each other. It should also be understood that, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the resource pool and the resource pool not overlapping may refer to, for example, the resource pool and the resource pool being orthonormal. In addition, the first resource pool may be divided into the first sub-resource pool and the second sub-resource pool, or may not be divided, but is used for data transmission by the terminal devices that use the second transmission mode and do not have the sensing capability. As shown in 4, the fourth resource pool includes the second resource pool and the third resource pool, where the first resource pool, the second resource pool, and the third resource pool do not overlap each other, and the fourth resource pool and the first resource pool do not overlap. The fourth resource pool includes the third resource pool. Since the fourth resource pool and the third resource pool may both correspond to the terminal device supporting the first transmission mode and their transmission resources are all allocated by the base station, mutual interference among the terminal devices can be avoided through scheduling by the base station. The fourth resource pool may also correspond to the terminal device having the sensing capability, so that interference with the terminal device in the third resource pool can be avoided by sensing. The fourth resource pool includes the second resource pool. If the terminal device in the fourth resource pool does not have the sensing capability, since the terminal device in the second resource pool has the sensing capability, interference with the terminal device in the fourth resource pool can be avoided by sensing. If the terminal device in the fourth resource pool has the sensing capability, the terminal devices in both of the fourth resource pool and the second resource pool have the sensing capability, which can avoid interference among the terminal devices. And because the terminal device in the fourth resource pool may have the sensing capability, or may not have the sensing capability, it is possible for the terminal device having the sensing capability to avoid interference with other terminal devices in the fourth resource pool by sensing. The fourth resource pool does not overlap the first sub-resource pool or the second sub-resource pool. Because the terminal devices in the first sub-resource pool and the second sub-resource pool do not have the sensing capability, interference with the terminal device in the fourth resource pool cannot be avoided, and resource pool sharing cannot be achieved. The interference from the terminal device having no sensing capability with the terminal device in the fourth resource pool can be avoided by dividing into non-overlapping resource pools. Therefore, in one aspect, the resource pool of the terminal device that does not have the sensing capability and supports the second transmission mode is separated from the resource pool of the terminal device that has the sensing capability and supports the second transmission mode, thereby avoiding the interference from the terminal device that randomly selects the resource with the terminal device that selects the resource by sensing; in another aspect, the resource pool of the terminal device that does not have the sensing capability and supports the second transmission mode is separated from the resource pool of the terminal device that supports the first transmission mode, thereby avoiding the interference from the terminal device that randomly selects the resource with the terminal device of which the resource is allocated based on the base station; in yet another aspect, a larger resource pool range can be used by configuring a larger resource pool for both the terminal device that supports the version of Release-15 and uses the first transmission mode and the terminal device that supports the version of Release-15, has the sensing capability and supports the second transmission mode, thereby improving the resource utilization. Manner 2The terminal device having the sensing capability and the terminal device having no sensing capability may share a resource pool. 1 If the terminal device supports the communication protocol of the version of Release-14 and does not support the communication protocol of the version of Release-15, the terminal device determines the resource pool for data transmission by the terminal device, including:if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode, determining that the resource pool is a fifth resource pool;if the terminal device uses the first transmission mode, determining that the resource pool is a sixth resource pool, and the sixth resource pool does not overlap the fifth resource pool. In an embodiment, the fifth resource pool includes a third sub-resource pool and a fourth sub-resource pool, where the terminal device determines that the resource pool is the fifth resource pool, including: if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode, determining that the resource pool is the third sub-resource pool in the fifth resource pool. 2 If the terminal device supports the communication protocol of the version of Release-15, the terminal device determines the resource pool for data transmission by the terminal device, including:if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and does not have the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is the fifth resource pool;if the terminal device uses the first transmission mode, determining that the resource pool is a seventh resource pool, and the seventh resource pool does not overlap the fifth resource pool;if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and has the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is an eighth resource pool. In an embodiment, the terminal device determines that the resource pool is the fifth resource pool, including: if the terminal device uses the second transmission mode and does not have the sensing capability, determining that the resource pool is the fourth sub-resource pool in the fifth resource pool. In an embodiment, in the Manner 2, the seventh resource pool includes the sixth resource pool. In an embodiment, in the Manner 2, the eighth resource pool includes at least one of the following resource pools: the fifth resource pool, the sixth resource pool and the seventh resource pool. For example, as the schematic diagram of resource pool division shown in 5, the plurality of resource pools in 5 include the fifth resource pool, the sixth resource pool, the seventh resource pool and the eighth resource pool. The fifth resource pool does not overlap the sixth resource pool, and the fifth resource pool does not overlap the seventh resource pool. Each of the resource pools is used for data transmission by a corresponding type of terminal devices. Table 2 shows the types of terminal devices corresponding to the different resource pools. TABLE 2 Resource Pool Type of the Terminal Device The fifth The third Support the version of Release-14, do not support the version resource sub-resource pool of Release-15, and use the second transmission mode Pool The fourth Support the version of Release-15, use the second sub-resource pool transmission mode, and do not have the sensing capability The sixth resource pool Support the version of Release-14, do not support the version of Release-15, and use the first transmission mode The seventh resource pool Support the version of Release-15, and use the first transmission mode The eighth resoure pool Support the version of Release-15, use the second transmission mode, and have the sensing capabilityThe eighth resource pool includes at least one of the following resource pools: the fifth resource pool, the sixth resource pool and the seventh resource pool. The range of the eighth resource pool may be greater than the range of the fifth resource pool, the sixth resource pool and the seventh resource pool. It should be understood that the eighth resource pool includes at least one of the fifth resource pool, the sixth resource pool and the seventh resource pool, or the fifth resource pool may include the eighth resource pool, or the sixth resource pool may include the eighth resource pool, or the seventh resource pool may include the eighth resource pool. The size and location relationship between the fifth resource pool and the eighth resource pool, the size and location relationship between the sixth resource pool and the eighth resource pool, and the size and location relationship between the seventh resource pool and the eighth resource pool are not limited in the embodiment of the present disclosure, as long as the fifth resource pool does not overlap the sixth resource pool, and the fifth resource pool does not overlap the seventh resource pool. In addition, the fifth resource pool may be divided into the third sub-resource pool and the fourth sub-resource pool, or may not be divided, but is used for data transmission by the terminal device that supports the version of Release-14 and uses the second transmission mode, and by the terminal device that supports the version of Release-15, uses the second transmission mode and does not have the sensing capability. As shown in 5, the fifth resource pool does not overlap the sixth resource pool, and the fifth resource pool does not overlap the seventh resource pool. The seventh resource pool includes the sixth resource pool. Since for the terminal devices in both the sixth resource pool and the seventh resource pool, resources are allocated by the base station, the terminal devices in the sixth resource pool and the seventh resource pool do not interfere with each other. The seventh resource pool does not overlap the third sub-resource pool and the fourth sub-resource pool. Since the third sub-resource pool and the fourth sub-resource pool have the terminal devices that do not have the sensing capability, such terminal devices randomly select resources, causing interference with the terminal device in the seventh resource pool. The eighth resource pool includes the seventh resource pool. The terminal device in the eighth resource pool has the sensing capability, and interference with the terminal device in the seventh resource pool can be avoided by sensing. The eighth resource pool includes the third sub-resource pool and the fourth sub-resource pool. Among the terminal devices that support Release-14, the terminal device having the sensing capability and the terminal device having no sensing capability can share a resource pool. Similarly, among the terminal devices that support Release-15, the terminal device having the sensing capability and the terminal device having no sensing capability may also share a resource pool. Moreover, a larger resource pool range can be used by configuring a larger resource pool for both the terminal device that supports the version of Release-15 and uses the first transmission mode and the terminal device that supports the version of Release-15, has the sensing capability and supports the second transmission mode, thereby improving the resource utilization. Based on the above description, using the embodiment of the present disclosure, different resource pools are obtained for different types of terminal devices by dividing, and the relationships between the resource pools are coordinated reasonably, so that different types of terminal devices transmit data together in the communication system and mutual interference is reduced, which in particular ensures the transmission reliability of the terminal devices that transmits data using the first transmission mode, and simultaneously enables the terminal device that supports the new version to have a larger resource pool range, improving the resource utilization. At least one of the following information of the different types of terminal devices is different: the supported version of the protocol, the transmission mode in use, and whether or not there is the sensing capability. It should be understood that, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the terminal device supporting Release-15 may include the terminal device supporting Release-15 or the terminal device of other versions that support Release-15, for example, the terminal device of Release-16 that supports Release-15. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the first transmission mode may be, for example, the foregoing transmission mode 3 in Release-14 of the 3GPP protocol, and when the terminal device uses the first transmission mode, the time-frequency resource for the data transmission by the terminal device is a resource scheduled by the network device; the second transmission mode may be, for example, the foregoing transmission mode 4 in Release-14 of the 3GPP protocol, and when the terminal device uses the second transmission mode, the time-frequency resource is a resource that can be selected independently by the terminal device, such as the resource selected randomly in a corresponding resource pool, or the resource determined by the terminal device based on a result of resource sensing. 6 is a schematic flowchart of a method for D2D communication according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The embodiments described below with reference to the accompanying drawings are exemplary, are only used to explain the embodiments of the present disclosure, and should not be construed as limit to the embodiments of the present disclosure. A display switching device, a display device and an electronic device according to embodiments of the present disclosure are described below with reference to the drawings. 1 is a structural schematic diagram of a display switching device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As illustrated in 1, the display switching device according to the embodiment of the present disclosure comprises a lens array 1 and a controller 2. The lens array 1 comprises a plurality of diffractive lenticular lenses 10, wherein each of the diffractive lenticular lenses 10 comprises a same structure. 2 is a structural schematic diagram of a diffractive lenticular lens 10 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Each of the diffractive lenticular lenses 10 may comprise a first substrate 11, wherein the first substrate 11 comprises a diffraction phase grating array 111; a liquid crystal element 12, comprising liquid crystal that are filled in the diffraction phase grating array 111; a first electrode layer and a second electrode layer that are configured to apply a voltage to the liquid crystal element, wherein the controller is configured to acquire a corresponding display mode and apply a control voltage corresponding to the display mode to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer according to the display mode to change a refractive index state of the liquid crystal element. Here, the liquid crystal in the liquid crystal element are at least filled between the diffraction phase grating array, and may also be on and between the diffraction phase grating array. For example, the first electrode layer 13 may be located above the diffraction phase grating array, an insulating layer 14 may be arranged between the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15, and the second electrode layer 15 may be located on the insulating layer 14. 2 illustrates an exemplary structure of such a diffractive lenticular lens 10. For example, arrangement positions of the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer may not be as illustrated in 2, and embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto as long as the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer are configured to be capable of applying a voltage to the liquid crystal element to deflect the liquid crystal in the liquid crystal element. For example, the first electrode layer 13 may be arranged on a side of the first substrate 11 opposite to the liquid crystal element, and the second electrode layer 15 may be arranged on a side of the liquid crystal element 12 opposite to the first substrate 11. Here, it should be noted that the application of the control voltage corresponding to the display mode to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer comprises a situation that no voltage is applied to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, for example, a voltage of zero is applied to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, or a same voltage is applied to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer and there is no potential difference between the two electrode layers. Wherein the controller 2 is used to acquire a corresponding display mode, and apply the control voltage corresponding to the display mode to the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15 according to the display mode to change the refractive index state of the liquid crystal element 12. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the diffraction phase grating array 111 may comprise a plurality of first phase grating groups 111a and second phase grating groups 111b that are periodically arranged, and the first phase grating group 111a and the second phase grating group 111b are symmetrically arranged with respect to a center line of the diffractive lenticular lens 10. Wherein a structural schematic diagram of the diffraction phase grating array 111 corresponding to one period is illustrated in 3. Wherein each of the first phase grating group 111a and the second phase grating group 111b comprises first to M-th grating element, that is, the first phase grating group 111a is composed of the first to the M-th grating element, and the second phase grating group 111b is composed of the first to the M-th grating element. Wherein M is a positive integer. Wherein each grating element comprises N steps. Wherein N is 2{circumflex over }m, m is a positive integer.

Wherein, a first side of each grating element comprises a plurality of steps. For example, supposing that each of the first phase grating group 111a and the second phase grating group 111b comprises three grating elements, 4 schematically illustrates sectional structure diagram of a part of the diffraction phase grating array 111 corresponding to each of the grating element comprising two steps, four steps and eight steps respectively. It can be seen from 4 that for the grating element comprising two steps, there are two steps on the first side; for the grating element comprising four steps, there are four steps on the first side; for the grating element comprising eight steps, there are eight steps on the first side. It should be understood that each grating element in this embodiment comprises N steps so that a groove may be formed in each grating element. The liquid crystal element 12 is filled in the diffraction phase grating array 111 and the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal element 12 may fill the groove of the grating element to improve the image display effect. Wherein r j , 1 = [ f + 2 j - 1 2 n 1 2 - f 2 ] 1 / 2 = 2 j - 1 f n 1 1 + 2 j - 1 4 n 1 f 1 / 2 r j , 2 = [ f + j n 1 2 - f 2 ] 1 / 2 = 2 jf n 1 1 + j 2 n 1 f 1 / 2 1 wherein f is an object focal length of the lens, and n1 is a refractive index of an object medium where the first substrate is located. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, widths of consecutive N-1 steps in each grating element are same, and widths of remaining steps are different from the widths of the N-1 steps, wherein the widths of the consecutive N-1 steps in the j-th grating element is t j , 2 = d j , 2 N 2 , 2 The widths of the remaining steps in the j-th grating element is t j , 1 = d j , 1 - i = 1 m - 1 d j , 2 2 i ,wherein dj,1=rj,1rj-1,2, dj,2=rj,2rj,1.

Where each grating element comprises four steps, a width of a step that is different from widths of the other three steps in a first grating element may be determined according to a formula for calculating a step width t 1 , 1 = d 1 , 1 - d 1 , 2 2 , and a width of each of the remaining three steps is t 1 , 2 = d 1 , 2 2 , a width of a step that is different from widths of the other three steps in a second grating element is t 2 , 1 = d 2 , 1 - d 2 , 2 2 , and a width of each of the remaining three steps is t 2 , 2 = d 2 , 2 2 , a width of a step that is different from widths of the other three steps in a third grating element is t 3 , 1 = d 3 , 1 - d 3 , 2 2 , and a width of each of the remaining three steps is t 3 , 2 = d 3 , 2 2 . Wherein it should be understood that for 4, where each grating element comprises eight steps, widths of the steps may also be calculated by the formulas 2 and 3, which will not be described here again. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the first electrode layer 13 may comprise a plurality of electrode strips. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, each of the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15 may comprise a transparent electrode. For example, a transparent electrode in the first electrode layer 13 may be a strip-shaped electrode, and a transparent electrode in the second electrode layer 15 may be a plane-shaped electrode. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, if a corresponding display mode acquired by the controller 2 is a 3D display mode, the controller 2 may not apply a voltage to the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15, that is, there is no voltage between the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15. Where there is no voltage between the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15, a refractive index of the liquid crystal element 12 is a low refractive index, that is, the liquid crystal element 12 is in a low refractive index state with respect to incident polarized light. At this time, the lens array 1 plays a role of a diffractive lens array, that is, the lens array is a diffractive lenticular lens array, and at this time, the display switching device enters the 3D display mode. Where a corresponding display mode acquired by the controller 2 is a 2D display mode, the controller 2 may apply a voltage to the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15, that is, a voltage is applied between the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15. Where the voltage is applied to the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15, the refractive index of the liquid crystal element 12 is a high refractive index, that is, the liquid crystal element 12 is in a high refractive index state with respect to the incident polarized light. At this time, the lens array 1 plays a role of a plate glass, that is, the lens array is a glass to make the display switching device enter the 2D display mode. Wherein where there is no voltage applied to the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15, a deflection state of the liquid crystal of the liquid crystal element in the diffractive lenticular lens is illustrated in 2. Wherein where voltages are applied to the first electrode layer 13 and the second electrode layer 15, a partial sectional structure diagram of the diffractive lenticular lens is illustrated in 5. 5 schematically illustrates the deflection state of the liquid crystal of the liquid crystal element in the diffractive lenticular lens in this situation. In the display switching device of the embodiment of the present disclosure, the liquid crystal elements of the lens array are filled in the diffraction phase grating array of the first substrate, a first electrode layer is arranged on the diffraction phase grating array, an insulation layer is arranged on the first electrode layer, a second electrode layer is arranged on the insulation layer, and a corresponding display mode is acquired by the controller, and a control voltage corresponding to the display mode is applied to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer according to the display mode to change the refractive index state of the liquid crystal element. Therefore, a display switching device with a simple structure is provided, which facilitates the subsequent use to be combined with a display component and realizes 2D and 3D switchable display effects. In order to implement the above embodiments, the embodiments of the present disclosure also provide a display device. 6 is a structural schematic diagram of a display device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As illustrated in 6, the display device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure comprises a display component 100 and a display switching device 200 that is located on the display component, wherein:It should be noted that the above description of the display switching device 200 also applies to this embodiment, and details are not described here again. The display component 100 may be a liquid crystal display LCD or an organic light-emitting diode OLED. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, supposing that a transmission axis on a light emitting side of the display component is perpendicular to an initial alignment of a long axis of liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal element, at this time, in a situation that a voltage is not applied to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal element have a low refractive index with respect to incident polarized light, and the lens array functions as a diffractive lenticular lens array and when combined with the display component, the display device can realize a 3D display function. In addition, where a corresponding control voltage is applied to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal element have a high refractive index with respect to the incident polarized light. At this time, the liquid crystal molecules have a high refractive index with respect to the incident polarized light, which is equal to a refractive index of a lower substrate. It is equivalent to fill the diffractive grating on the first substrate. Therefore, the lens array functions as a plate glass and when combined with a display component, the display device can realize a 2D display function. It should be understood that where the transmission axis of the display component is parallel to an initial alignment of a long axis of the liquid crystal molecules in the liquid crystal element, 3D display can also be realized when the electrode is powered on, and 2D display can be achieved when the electrode is powered off. Wherein it should be noted that, in some situations, the initial alignment of the liquid crystal element may not be performed, and whether the initial alignment of the liquid crystal element is performed relates to a shape of the liquid crystal element. For example, the liquid crystal element is a blue phase liquid crystal molecular material, and since its molecule initial state is spherical, it is not necessary to perform the initial alignment. In the display device of the embodiment of the present disclosure, a corresponding display mode is acquired by the controller, and a control voltage corresponding to the display mode is applied to the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer according to the display mode to change the refractive index state of the liquid crystal element. Therefore, a display device with a simple structure and a switchable display mode is provided, which is convenient for a user to perform switching display of 2D and 3D effects based on the display device. 7 is a principle structure schematic diagram of a display device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Wherein a coordinate origin in 7 is located in a center of a number 0 lens in the diffractive lenticular lens array, an X-axis coincides with an optical axis of the number 0 lens, and a Y-axis is parallel to a pixel plane of the display component. In a positive direction of the Y-axis, numbers of the diffractive lenticular lenses are 1, 2, . . . , k, . . . , and in a negative direction of the Y-axis, numbers of the diffractive lenticular lenses are 1, 2, . . . , k, . . . , respectively. Supposing that a user is in a center of a display screen, in this situation, a viewpoint of each parallax image is symmetrically distributed with respect to the X-axis.

According to geometric relations, the follows will be obtained: h k , i f = kp - [ i - m + 1 / 2 ] e l 4 h k , i + 1 f = kp - [ i + 1 - m + 1 / 2 ] e l 5 Wherein p is a width of a unit diffractive lens and l is a viewing distance for the human eyes. According to formulas 4 and 5 we can obtain: h k , i = f kp - [ i - m + 1 / 2 ] e l 6 h k , i + 1 = f kp - [ i + 1 - m + 1 / 2 ] e l 7 Supposing a pixel width of the display component is t, thus: t=hk,ihk,i+18Combined with formulas 6, 7 and 8, an object focal length of the diffractive lenticular lens can be obtained: f = tl e 9 In addition, an object point of the i-th parallax image that are seen by the eyes through the k-th lens should fall within a pixel viewing field of the parallax image, that is: mkt + m 2 - i t &lt; kp + h k , i &lt; mkt + m 2 - i + 1 t 10 Bring formulas 6 and 9 to the formula 10, we can obtain: met e + t - et 2 k e + t &lt; p &lt; met e + t + et 2 k e + t 11 Therefore, a suitable value of p is: p = met e + t 12 An allowable float range is et 2 k e + t . Wherein at m=2, the width of the unit diffractive lenticular lens can be obtained as p = 2 et e + t .

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept relate to a display device, a power supply device for the display device, and a driving method of the display device. More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept relate to a display device, a power supply device for the display device, and a driving method of the display device for more effectively generating a driving voltage.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "A display device includes a DC-DC converter that converts power supplied from the outside to generate a driving voltage for driving the display device. The DC-DC converter must be able to generate a stable driving voltage through a predetermined voltage. In general, the DC-DC converter repeatedly turns a switch on and off with a predetermined frequency to generate a predetermined driving voltage. This predetermined frequency is referred to as a switching frequency. At each time that the switch turns on and off, a power loss occurs during a rising time and a falling time of a current and a voltage flowing through the switch. This power loss is proportional to the switching frequency of the switch. The display device does not always operate with a constant load. The load of a display device may vary according to frame units that represent an image. For example, the display device may operate with a heavy load while the image is displayed in one frame, and the display device may operate with a light load while the displayed image for the one frame is reset so that the image is not displayed. When the DC-DC converter generates the driving voltage with a constant switching frequency irrespective of the load of the display device, unnecessary power loss may occur, and then the efficiency of the DC-DC converter may deteriorate and heat generation may be increased.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "Exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept provide a display device, a power supply device for the display device, and a driving method of the display device for more effectively generating a driving voltage. Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like reference numerals may refer to like elements throughout this application. 1 is a block diagram showing a display device according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. Referring to 1, a display device 10 includes a signal controller 100, a scan driver 200, a data driver 300, a power supply unit 400, and a display unit 600. The signal controller 100 receives an input image signal ImS and a synchronization signal from an external device. The input image signal ImS includes luminance information of a plurality of pixels PX. The luminance has a gray level of a predetermined number, for example, 1024=210, 256=28, or 64=26. The synchronization signal includes a horizontal synchronization signal Hsync, a vertical synchronization signal Vsync, and a main clock signal MCLK. The signal controller 100 generates a first driving control signal CONT1, a second driving control signal CONT2, and an image data signal ImD based on the image signal ImS, the horizontal synchronization signal Hsync, the vertical synchronization signal Vsync, and the main clock signal MCLK. The signal controller 100 divides the image signal ImS into frame units based on the vertical synchronization signal Vsync, and divides the image signal ImS into scan line units based on the horizontal synchronization signal Hsync to generate the image data signal ImD. The signal controller 100 transmits the image data signal ImD to the data driver 300 along with the first driving control signal CONT1. The display unit 600 is a display area including the plurality of pixels PX. The display unit 600 includes a plurality of scan lines connected to the plurality of pixels PX, a plurality of data lines connected to the plurality of pixels PX, and a plurality of power lines connected to the plurality of pixels PX. The plurality of scan lines may extend approximately in the row direction and be approximately parallel to one another. A plurality of data lines may extend approximately in a column direction and be approximately parallel to one another. The plurality of pixels PX may be arranged in a form of a matrix in intersecting regions of the plurality of scan lines and the plurality of data lines. The scan driver 200 is connected to the plurality of scan lines, and generates a plurality of scan signals S[1]-S[n] according to the second driving control signal CONT2. The scan driver 200 may sequentially apply the scan signals S[1]-S[n] having a gate-on voltage to the plurality of scan lines. The data driver 300 is connected to the plurality of data lines, samples and holds the image data signal ImD according to the first driving control signal CONT1, and applies a plurality of data signals data[1]-data[m] to the plurality of data lines. The data driver 300 applies the data signals data[1]-data[m] having a predetermined voltage range to the plurality of data lines in correspondence with the scan signals S[1]-S [n] having the gate-on voltage. The power supply unit 400 supplies a first driving voltage VDD1 to the display unit 600. The first driving voltage VDD1 is supplied to the power line connected to the plurality of pixels PX to provide a driving current for the emission of the plurality of pixels PX. The power supply unit 400 may supply a second driving voltage VDD2 to the data driver 300. The second driving voltage VDD2 having a voltage for the operation of the data driver 300 may be used as a source power for the data signals data[1]-data[m]. The power supply unit 400 may supply a third driving voltage VDD3 to the scan driver 200. The third driving voltage VDD3 having the voltage for the operation of the scan driver 200 may be used as a power voltage to generate the scan signals S[1]-S[n] having the gate-on voltage. The power supply unit 400 may supply a fourth driving voltage VDD4 to the signal controller 100. The fourth driving voltage VDD4 may be used as a voltage for operation of the signal controller 100. The display unit 600, the data driver 300, the scan driver 200, the signal controller 100, and the like may be loads of the power supply unit 400. As such, the power supply unit 400 may be a power supply device that provides the overall power for driving the display device 10. The power supply unit 400 may include at least one among a first driving voltage generator 410 of 2, a second driving voltage generator 420 of 6, a third driving voltage generator 430 of 7, or a fourth driving voltage generator 440 of 8. 2 is a view showing a driving voltage generator according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. Referring to 2, the first driving voltage generator 410 includes an inductor L1, a switch S1, a diode D1, a plurality of resistors R1, R2, and R3, a plurality of capacitors C1, C2, and C3, a switch controller 411, a plurality of differential amplifiers 421 and 422, and a latch unit 431. The inductor L1 is connected between an input terminal IN1 and a driving voltage output terminal OUT1. The inductor L1 includes one terminal connected to the input terminal IN1 to which an input voltage Vin is input and the other terminal connected to a first electrode of the switch S1. The input voltage Vin may be a direct current DC voltage provided from an external power source. The first capacitor C1 may be connected to the input terminal IN1. The first capacitor C1 includes a first electrode connected to the input terminal IN1 and a second electrode connected to a ground GND. The switch S1 is connected between the inductor L1 and the ground GND. The switch S1 includes a gate electrode connected to an output terminal Q of the latch unit 431, the first electrode connected to the other terminal of the inductor L1, and a second electrode connected to the ground GND. The switch S1 may be an n-channel electric field effect transistor. The gate-on voltage that turns on the n-channel electric field effect transistor is a high level voltage, and the gate-off voltage that turns it off is a low level voltage. According to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept, the switch S1 may be a p-channel electric field effect transistor. In this case, the gate-on voltage that turns on the p-channel electric field effect transistor is the low level voltage, and the gate-off voltage that turns it off is the high level voltage. The diode D1 is connected between the inductor L1 and the driving voltage output terminal OUT1. The diode D1 includes a first electrode connected to the other terminal of the inductor L1 and a second electrode connected to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1. An output driving voltage Vout is output to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1. The output driving voltage Vout may be one among the first to fourth driving voltages VDD1, VDD2, VDD3, and VDD4 described above with reference to 1. The second capacitor C2 may be connected to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1. The second capacitor C2 includes a first electrode connected to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 and a second electrode connected to the ground GND. The second capacitor C2 may stably maintain the voltage of the driving voltage output terminal OUT1. The first resistor R1 includes one terminal connected to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 and the other terminal connected to the second resistor R2. The second resistor R2 includes one terminal connected to the other terminal of the first resistor R1 and the other terminal connected to the ground GND. In other words, the first resistor R1 and the second resistor R2 may be coupled in series between the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 and the ground GND. The voltage corresponding to the voltage difference between the output driving voltage Vout output to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 and the ground voltage is distributed to the first resistor R1 and the second resistor R2. A distribution voltage Vdis between the first resistor R1 and the second resistor R2 has the voltage value between the output driving voltage Vout and the ground voltage according to the resistance of the first resistor R1 and the second resistor R2. The first differential amplifier 421 includes a first input terminal , a second input terminal +, and an output terminal. The distribution voltage Vdis is input to the first input terminal of the first differential amplifier 421, and a reference voltage Vref is input to the second input terminal +. The reference voltage Vref may be a predetermined voltage for compensating an error of the output driving voltage Vout. The voltage difference between the distribution voltage Vdis and the reference voltage Vref is amplified by a constant gain and output as a compensation voltage Vcomp from the output terminal of the first differential amplifier 421. The third capacitor C3 is connected between the output terminal of the first differential amplifier 421 and the ground GND, and the third resistor R3 is connected between the output terminal of the first differential amplifier 421 and the third capacitor C3. The switch controller 411 includes a pulse generator 4111, a current measuring unit 4112, and an adder 4113. The pulse generator 4111 is described with reference to 3. 3 is a view showing a pulse generator according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. Referring to 3, the pulse generator 4111 includes a ramp pulse generator 4115. The ramp pulse generator 4115 includes an input terminal INp and an output terminal OUTp. The ramp pulse generator 4115 receives a current or voltage at the input terminal INp and outputs a ramp pulse at the output terminal OUTp. The ramp pulse generator 4115 compares the value of the current or voltage input to the input terminal INp with a plurality of reference values REF1, REF2, REF3, . . . that are predetermined. The ramp pulse generator 4115 may output a plurality of ramp pulses having different frequencies, which correspond to the plurality of reference values REF1, REF2, REF3, . . . . In other words, the ramp pulse generator 4115 selects a reference value corresponding to the input current or voltage, and may output a ramp pulse having a frequency corresponding to the selected reference value among the plurality of ramp pulses. A ramp pulse can have a sawtooth wave form in which a change, at which the voltage or current increases linearly with time and suddenly decreases when it reaches a certain magnitude to return to its original value, is repeated. The ramp pulse generator 4115 may output the ramp pulse having a relatively low frequency when the value of the current or voltage input to the input terminal INp is high, and may output the ramp pulse having a relatively high frequency when the value of the current or voltage input to the input terminal INp is low. For example, the ramp pulse generator 4115 may receive the current flowing to the input terminal INp through the switch S1. When the first reference value REF1 is larger than the second reference value REF2 and the second reference value REF2 is larger than the third reference value REF3, the ramp pulse generator 4115 may output the ramp pulse having a low frequency if the first reference value REF1 is selected, may output the ramp pulse having a high frequency if the third reference value REF3 is selected, and may output the ramp pulse having a middle frequency if the second reference value REF2 is selected. For example, the low frequency may be referred to as a first frequency, the high frequency may be referred to as a second frequency, and the middle frequency may be referred to as a third frequency. In other words, the first frequency is lower than the second frequency. The third frequency is higher than the first frequency and lower than the second frequency. Referring again to 2, the pulse generator 4111 receives the current flowing to the switch S1. In other words, the pulse generator 4111 may receive the current flowing through the inductor L1 and the switch S1 from the input terminal IN1. The current flowing through the switch S1 is received at the input terminal INp of the ramp pulse generator 4115 of 3. The pulse generator 4111 may compare the current flowing through the switch S1 with the plurality of reference values REF1, REF2, REF3, . . . to select the reference value corresponding to the received current, and may output the ramp pulse, having the frequency corresponding to the selected reference value, to the adder 4113. The current measuring unit 4112 measures the current through the switch S1 and outputs a voltage corresponding to the measured current to the adder 4113. The adder 4113 adds the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 to the ramp pulse output from the pulse generator 4111. The adder 4113 outputs the ramp pulse, of which the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 is added to the ramp pulse output from the pulse generator 4111, to the second differential amplifier 422. The second differential amplifier 422 includes a first input terminal , a second input terminal +, and an output terminal. The compensation voltage Vcomp output from the first differential amplifier 421 is input to the first input terminal of the second differential amplifier 422, and the ramp pulse output from the adder 4113 is input to the second input terminal +. The voltage difference between the ramp pulse and the compensation voltage Vcomp is amplified with a constant gain to the output terminal of the second differential amplifier 422 and output as a switch control signal Csw. The switch control signal Csw may be output in a pulse form corresponding to the voltage difference between the ramp pulse and the compensation voltage Vcomp. The latch unit 431 includes a first input terminal S, a second input terminal R, and the output terminal Q. An output control signal Fsw is input to the first input terminal S of the latch unit 431 and the switch control signal Csw is input to the second input terminal R. The latch unit 431 may limit the output of the switch control signal Csw according to the output control signal Fsw. The switch control signal Csw is output to the output terminal Q of the latch unit 431 to be transmitted to the gate electrode of the switch S1. However, the inventive concept is not limited thereto. According to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept, the latch unit 431 may be omitted. The switch control signal Csw has a switching frequency corresponding to the frequency of the ramp pulse. The switch S1 may be repeatedly turned on and off based on the switching frequency of the switch control signal Csw. When the switch S1 turns on, energy is stored in the inductor L1 as the current amount transferred to ground GND through the inductor L1 increases. When the switch S1 turns off, the current generated by the energy stored in the inductor L1 is delivered to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 via the diode D1. The voltage of the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 increases and the energy stored in the inductor L1 decreases gradually. Again, when the switch S1 is turned on, the energy is stored in the inductor L1 and the voltage of the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 decreases. Thus, the current amount and voltage delivered to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 by the switch control signal Csw may be adjusted. The current amount and voltage delivered to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 is determined by a duty of the switch S1. The duty may refer to a ratio of a turn-on time to a turn-off time of the switch S1 or a ratio of an on-time to an off-time of the switch control signal Csw. The duty of the switch S1 may be determined by the compensation voltage Vcomp output from the first differential amplifier 421. When the output driving voltage Vout output from the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 is lower than a desired voltage, the distribution voltage Vdis decreases. As the distribution voltage Vdis decreases, the compensation voltage Vcomp output from the first differential amplifier 421 also decreases. As the compensation voltage Vcomp decreases, the on time of the switch control signal Csw, output by the voltage difference between the ramp pulse and the compensation voltage Vcomp in the second differential amplifier 422, increases. Accordingly, the duty of the switch S1 is increased and the voltage of the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 is increased. When the output driving voltage Vout output to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 is higher than the desired voltage, the distribution voltage Vdis increases. As the distribution voltage Vdis increases, the compensation voltage Vcomp output from the first differential amplifier 421 also increases. As the compensation voltage Vcomp increases, the on-time of the switch control signal Csw, output by the voltage difference between the ramp pulse and the compensation voltage Vcomp in the second differential amplifier 422, decreases. Accordingly, the duty of the switch S1 is reduced and the voltage of the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 is lowered. The switch controller 411 may change the frequency of the switch control signal Csw by changing and outputting the frequency of the ramp pulse according to the value of the current flowing through the switch S1. When the value of the current flowing through the switch S1 is large , the load is large, the switch controller 411 outputs the ramp pulse having the relatively low frequency, and when the value of the current flowing through the switch S1 is small , the load is small, it outputs the ramp pulse having the relatively high frequency, thus controlling the switching operation of the switch S1. In other words, when the value of the current flowing through the switch S1 is large , the load is large, the switch controller 411 outputs the switch control signal Csw having the relatively low frequency, when the value of the current flowing through the switch S1 is small , the load is small, it outputs the switch control signal Csw having the relatively high frequency, thus controlling the switching operation of the switch S1. Since the frequency at which the switch S1 is switched decreases when the load is large, the power loss caused due to the switching operation, in which the switch S1 is turned on and turned off, may be reduced. The power supply unit 400 of 1 including the first driving voltage generator 410 may generate the first through fourth driving voltages VDD1, VDD2, VDD3, and VDD4 based on the operation of the display device 10. The load of the display device 10 may be changed by a frame unit representing an image. For example, the display device 10 may operate with a heavy load while the image is displayed in one frame, and the display device 10 operates with a light load by initializing the displayed image for one frame while the image is not displayed. As the power supply unit 400 outputs the ramp pulse , the switch control signal Csw having the low frequency while the display device 10 operates with the heavy load and outputs the ramp pulse , the switch control signal Csw having the high frequency while the display device 10 operates with the light load, the power loss may be reduced, and the first through fourth driving voltages VDD1, VDD2, VDD3, and VDD4 may be more effectively generated. This is described with reference to 1, 4, and 5. First, a driving method of the display device according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept is described with reference to 1 and 4. 4 is a view showing a driving method of a display device according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. Referring to 1 and 4, the display device 10 displays the image in frame units. A time unit in which one image is displayed on the display device 10 is referred to as a frame. One frame may include a writing-in period P1, a light emission period P2, and a reset period P3. During the writing-in period P1, the plurality of data signals data[1]-data[m] are input to the plurality of pixels PX. During the writing-in period P1, the scan driver 200 may sequentially apply the scan signals S[1]-S[n] having the gate-on voltage to the plurality of scan lines, and the data driver 300 may apply the data signals data[1]-data[m] to the plurality of data lines in correspondence with the scan signals S[1]-S [n]. During the light emission period P2, the plurality of pixels PX are emitted with a brightness corresponding to the input data signals data[1]-data[m]. During the light emission period P2, the first driving voltage VDD1 may provide the driving current for the emission of the plurality of pixels PX. During the reset period P3 subsequent to the light emission period P2, the plurality of pixels PX are reset to a 0 gray. In other words, the reset period P3 is a period in which the image is not displayed. A section in which the display device 10 is driven for displaying the image of one frame is referred to as an activation section, and the activation section may include the writing-in period P1 and the light emission period P2. During the activation section, the load of the display device 10 increases, resulting in a heavy load. The section in which the image is not displayed between the images of continuous frames is referred to as a blank section. The blank section may include the reset period P3. During the blank section, the load of the display device 10 drops to almost zero, resulting in a light load. As described above, when the load of the display device 10 is changed into the heavy load and the light load in each frame unit, the power supply unit 400 may change the frequency of the ramp pulse , the switch control signal Csw based on the load of the display device 10. For example, in the continuous first frame and second frame, a first blank section is disposed between a first activation section of the first frame and a second activation section of the second frame. A second blank section is located next to the second activation section. During the first activation section and the second activation section, the load of the display device 10 becomes the heavy load, and the load of the display device 10 becomes the light load during the first blank section and the second blank section. The power supply unit 400 outputs the switch control signal Csw , the ramp pulse having the low frequency during the first activation section and the second activation section. Additionally, the power supply unit 400 outputs the switch control signal Csw , the ramp pulse having the high frequency during the first blank section and the second blank section. When the load of the display device 10 in the first activation section and the load of the display device 10 in the second activation section are substantially the same, since the current amounts flowing through the switch S1 are substantially the same, the frequencies of the switch control signal Csw become substantially equal to one another in the first activation section and the second activation section. Additionally, the load of the display device 10 in the first blank section and the second blank section is approximately equal to zero, and thus the frequency of the switch control signal Csw in the first blank section and the second blank section may substantially be the same. The duty of the switch control signal Csw in the activation section is substantially the same as the duty of the switch control signal Csw in the blank section, while the frequency of the switch control signal Csw in the activation section is different from the frequency of the switch control signal Csw in the blank section. Therefore, during the activation section and the blank section, the first through fourth driving voltages VDD1, VDD2, VDD3, and VDD4 do not change. Next, a driving method of the display device according to an exemplary embodiment of inventive concept is described with reference to 1 and 5. Differences with respect to the exemplary embodiment of 4 will be mainly described. 5 is a view showing a driving method of a display device according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. Referring to 1 and 5, the display device 10 can display a low luminance image overall. In this case, the load of the display device 10 may be an intermediate load that is smaller than the heavy load and larger than the light load. When the load of the display device 10 becomes the intermediate load, the power supply unit 400 may output the switch control signal Csw , the ramp pulse having a frequency , the third frequency that is higher than the frequency , the first frequency corresponding to the heavy load and lower than the frequency , the second frequency corresponding to the light load. The heavy load may be referred to as a first load, the light load may be referred to as a second load, and the intermediate load may be referred to as a third load. Thus, the first load is greater than the second load. The third load is smaller than the first load and larger than the second load. For example, in successive third and fourth frames, a third blank section is disposed between a third activation section of the third frame and a fourth activation section of the fourth frame, and a fourth blank section is disposed subsequent to the fourth activation section. During the third activation section, while the load of the display device 10 becomes the heavy load, the load of the display device 10 during the fourth activation section may become the intermediate load. The power supply unit 400 may output the switch control signal Csw having the low frequency during the third activation section and may output the switch control signal Csw having the intermediate frequency during the fourth activation section. For example, during the third activation section, the load of the display device 10 corresponds to the first reference value REF1 of 3 such that the ramp pulse having the frequency corresponding to the first reference value REF1 may be output, during the fourth activation section, the load of the display device 10 corresponds to the second reference value REF2 of 3 such that the ramp pulse having the frequency corresponding to the second reference value REF2 may be output, and during the third and fourth blank sections, the load of the display device 10 corresponds to the third reference value REF3 of 3 such that the ramp pulse having the frequency corresponding to the third reference value REF3 may be output. In other words, in the activation section of the plurality of frames, the loads of the display device 10 may be different from one another, and in this case, the frequencies of the switch control signal Csw , the ramp pulse may be different from one another in the activation section of the plurality of frames. Although the frequencies of the switch control signal Csw are different from one another, the duty of the switch control signal Csw is the same. Except for these differences, the features of the exemplary embodiment described with reference to 1 and 4 may all be applied to the exemplary embodiment described with reference to 1 and 5, and thus redundant descriptions between the illustrated exemplary embodiments are omitted. Next, a driving voltage generator according to exemplary embodiments of the inventive concept is described with reference to 6 to 8. The differences from the above-described exemplary embodiment in 1 to 5 are mainly described. 6 is a view showing a driving voltage generator according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. Referring to 6, the second driving voltage generator 420 includes the pulse generator 4111 receiving the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1. In other words, the pulse generator 4111 receives the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 without receiving the current flowing through the switch S1. In other words, the ramp pulse generator 4115 of 3 receives the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 by the input terminal INp. The pulse generator 4111 may compare the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 with the plurality of reference values REF1, REF2, REF3, . . . to select the reference value corresponding to the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1, and may output the ramp pulse having the frequency corresponding to the selected reference value to the adder 4113. The switch controller 411 may change the frequency of the switch control signal Csw by changing and outputting the frequency of the ramp pulse based on the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1. When the value of the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 is large , the load is large, the switch controller 411 may output the ramp pulse having the relatively low frequency. Additionally, when the value of the current flowing to the driving voltage output terminal OUT1 is small , the load is small, the switch controller 411 may output the ramp pulse having the relatively high frequency. Except for these differences, the features of the exemplary embodiment described with reference to 1 to 5 may all be applied to the exemplary embodiment described with reference to 6, and thus redundant descriptions between the illustrated exemplary embodiments are omitted. 7 shows a driving voltage generator according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. The differences from the above-described exemplary embodiment of 1 to 5 are mainly described. Referring to 7, the third driving voltage generator 430 includes the pulse generator 4111 receiving the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112. In other words, the pulse generator 4111 receives the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 without receiving the current flowing through the switch S1. The voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 may have the voltage value corresponding to the current flowing through the switch S1. In other words, in 3, the ramp pulse generator 4115 receives the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 by the input terminal INp. The pulse generator 4111 may compare the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 with the plurality of reference values REF1, REF2, REF3, . . . to select the reference value corresponding to the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112, and may output the ramp pulse having the frequency corresponding to the selected reference value to the adder 4113. The switch controller 411 may change the frequency of the switch control signal Csw by changing and outputting the frequency of the ramp pulse based on the value of the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112. When the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 is large , the load is large, the switch controller 411 may output the ramp pulse having the relatively low frequency. Additionally, when the voltage output from the current measuring unit 4112 is small , the load is small, the switch controller 411 may output the ramp pulse having the relatively high frequency. Except for these differences, the features of the exemplary embodiment described with reference to 1 to 5 may all be applied to the exemplary embodiment described with reference to 7, and thus redundant descriptions between the illustrated exemplary embodiments are omitted. 8 is a view showing a driving voltage generator according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. The differences from the above-described 1 to 5 are mainly described. Referring to 8, the fourth driving voltage generator 440 includes the pulse generator 4111 receiving the vertical synchronization signal Vsync input to a second input terminal IN2. In other words, the pulse generator 4111 receives the vertical synchronization signal Vsync without receiving the current flowing through the switch S1. In other words, in 3, the ramp pulse generator 4115 receives the vertical synchronization signal Vsync by the input terminal INp. The vertical synchronization signal Vsync is a signal dividing the image into frame units. In this case, the ramp pulse generator 4115 may output the ramp pulse having the relatively low frequency during a predetermined first section , the activation section from the time at which the vertical synchronization signal Vsync is received as the on voltage without using the plurality of reference values REF1, REF2, REF3, . . . . Additionally, the ramp pulse generator 4115 may output the ramp pulse having the relatively high frequency during a predetermined second section , the blank section next to the first section. In other words, the pulse generator 4111 may output the ramp pulse having the low frequency to the adder 4113 during the first section based on the vertical synchronization signal Vsync, and may output the ramp pulse having the high frequency during the second section to the adder 4113.

Unless otherwise noted as having an obvious conflict, the embodiments or features included in various embodiments may be combined. The following embodiments do not limit the sequence of execution of the steps included in the disclosed methods. The sequence of the steps may be any suitable sequence, and certain steps may be repeated. 1, 2, and 9 show a headband according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. The headband may be included in wearable devices, such as wearable eye glasses, , wearable video eye glasses. The headband may include a headband body 60 and a headband adjusting device 81. The headband adjusting device 81 may include a transmission mechanism 50. Two ends of the transmission mechanism 50 may be pivotably coupled with the headband body 60. The headband adjusting device 81 and the headband body 60 may be coupled together to define or enclose a receiving chamber. The headband body 60 and a mounting base 10 of the headband adjusting device 81 may form a ring-shaped headband. The receiving chamber includes a space surrounded by the headband, and may be configured to receive a head of a user. In some embodiments, the headband body 60 includes a mounting member 61 and two connecting members 62 respectively coupled to two ends of the mounting member 61. The transmission mechanism 50 may be pivotably coupled with the two connecting members 62. In some embodiments, the mounting member 61 may be configured for mounting an eye glasses body 80. In some embodiments, the headband body 60 may have a U shape. In some embodiments, the headband body 60 may have a fixed shape, and may be configured to stably mount the eye glasses body 80. In some embodiments, the deformation of the headband body 60 may be small. As a result, the headband body 60 forms a hard headband having a stable shape and being comfortable to wear. In some embodiments, the transmission mechanism 50 may be pivotably coupled with the two connecting members, forming an enclosed receiving chamber. In some embodiments, the eye glasses body 80 may be mounted on the mounting member 61. The headband adjusting device 81 may be configured to adjust a position of the mounting base 10. In some embodiments, the transmission mechanism 50 that is pivotably coupled with the two connecting members 62 may pivotably rotate around a pivoting joint, causing the mounting base 10 to move away from or closer to the glasses body 80. As a result, the tightness of the headband may be conveniently adjusted. 3-8 show embodiments of a headband adjusting device that may be used in wearable devices, such as wearable glasses, , wearable video eye glasses. The headband adjusting device may include a mounting base 10, a linkage 20, a thumbwheel 30, and a transmission mechanism 50. In some embodiments, the mounting base 10 may include an internal ratchet 11. In some embodiments, the internal ratchet 11 may include a plurality of ratchet teeth 111. The ratchet teeth 111 may be disposed along a clockwise direction or a counter-clockwise direction. In some embodiments, the linkage 20 may be mounted on the mounting base 10. The linkage 20 may be rotatable around an axis. In some embodiments, the linkage 20 may include a transmission member 23 and at least one elastic position limiting member 21. The at least one elastic position limiting member 21 may be configured to abut against the ratchet teeth 111 of the internal ratchet 11. In some embodiments, the linkage 20 may include a plurality of position limiting members 21, such as two, three, four, etc. , which may be uniformly distributed on the linkage 20. The uniformly distributed position limiting members 21 may balance the forces experienced by the linkage 20 and may increase the tight locking force and the elastic force. In some embodiments, the thumbwheel 30 and the linkage 20 are coupled with one another. The rotation of the thumbwheel 30 may cause the linkage 20 to rotate. In some embodiments, the thumbwheel 30 may include a disengaging member 31 corresponding to the position limiting member 21. In some embodiments, when the thumbwheel 30 rotates in one direction, the disengaging member 31 abuts against the position limiting member 21 causing the position limiting member 21 to release the locking of the internal ratchet 11. When the thumbwheel 30 rotates in another direction, the position limiting member 21 rotates while contacting the internal ratchet 11. The transmission mechanism 50 and the transmission member 23 are coupled together such that motion in one may cause motion in another. The linkage 20 may rotate to cause the transmission mechanism 50 to extend or retract toward both ends of the transmission mechanism 50. In an initial state, the internal ratchet 11 is mounted on the mounting base 10. When the thumbwheel 30 rotates to a predetermined position and stops rotating, the at least one position limiting member 21 of the linkage 20 may abut against the ratchet teeth 111. The internal ratchet 11 and the position limiting member 21 of the linkage 20 may lock the thumbwheel 30. The transmission mechanism 50 may fix the position of the mounting base 10. The ratchet teeth 111 may limit the rotation capability of the linkage 20. The relative position between the mounting base 10 and the headband body 60 may be stable. The size of the headband may satisfy requirement for wearing on a user's head. Thus, the disclosed headband has improved stability and wearing comfort. The headband adjusting device 81 may be adjusted by a user based on the following operations: the thumbwheel 30 is rotated in a first direction such that the disengaging member 31 abuts against the position limiting member 21. The disengaging member 31 presses the position limiting member 21 to cause the position limiting member 21 to bend, causing the position limiting member 21 to unlock the ratchet teeth 111. The thumbwheel 30 continues to cause the linkage 20 to rotate. The transmission member 23 of the linkage 20 causes the transmission mechanism 50 to extend or retract, which causes the mounting base 10 to move and adjust the relative position relative to the headband body 60 as the transmission mechanism 50 moves. The structures enable convenient unlocking and adjustment. Because the ratchet teeth 111 are distributed in a clockwise direction or a counter-clockwise direction, when the thumbwheel 30 causes the linkage 20 to rotate in a second direction which may opposite the first direction, the linkage 20 may cause the position limiting member 21 to slide along the ratchet teeth 111. The transmission member 23 may cause the transmission mechanism 50 to extend or retract, thereby adjusting the volume of the receiving chamber located between the mounting base 10 and the headband body 60. The thumbwheel 30 may cause the linkage 20 to rotate in one direction or another to tighten or loosen the headband, thereby increasing the comfort of the headband and the flexibility of fitting different users. Because the internal ratchet 11 can be locked in one direction only, pressing the mounting base 10 can achieve quick extension or retraction. As shown in 6 and 7, the position limiting member 21 may include an elastic member 211 and a locking member 212 disposed on the elastic member 211. The locking member 212 may protrude along an axis of the linkage 20. The locking member 212 may abut against the internal ratchet 11. The elastic member 211 may be abutted, causing the locking member 212 to disengage from the internal ratchet 11. In some embodiments, the position limiting member 21 may be provided with the elastic member 211. The elastic member 211 may have a cantilever shape and may undergo elastic deformations. The locking member 212 may protrude along an axis of the linkage 20, and may be disposed on the elastic member 211. This structure increases the movable range of the position limiting member 21 and enhances the flexibility of the configuration of the linkage 20. In some embodiments, the locking member 212 may protrude from a side wall where the linkage 20 is located. As a result, the locking member 212 does not interfere with the rotation of the linkage 20. The locking member 212 may have a shape that matches the shape of the ratchet teeth 111. The locking member 212 and the internal ratchet 11 may lock together, making it convenient to engage with the internal ratchet 11 and flexible to rotate the linkage 20. In some embodiments, the mounting base 10 may be provided with a concave surface 13 and an opening 12 located at an end of the concave surface 13. The concave surface 13 may be formed by depression of an outer surface of the mounting base 10. The outer peripheral surface of the thumbwheel 30 may be located out of the concave surface 13. By providing the concave surface 13 and the opening 12, the area of the contact surface between the thumbwheel 30 and a user's finger can be increased. In addition, the diameter of the thumbwheel 30 may be reduced, thereby reducing the size of the mounting base 10. The surface area of the protruding portion of the thumbwheel 30 that protrudes out of the mounting base 10 may be reduced, increasing the aesthetics. In some embodiments, the elastic member 211 may include a boss 213 protruding along a radial direction of the linkage 20. A slope may be disposed at a joint between the boss 213 and the elastic member 211. In some embodiments, the locking member 212 and the boss 213 may be disposed in parallel, or may be interlaced with one another. The disengaging member 31 may be disposed on an inner wall of the thumbwheel 30 protruding from the inner wall. When a thumbwheel 30 is rotated, the disengaging member 31 may abut against the boss 213, causing the locking member 212 to disengage from the internal ratchet 11. In some embodiments, the disengaging member 31 may have a curved surface. As the thumbwheel 30 is rotated, a surface of the disengaging member 31 may slidably abut the boss 213 while closely contacting the elastic member 211. Alternatively, the disengaging member 31 may rotate to the slope and slide along the slope to abut against the boss 213. The height of the boss 213 may be greater than the locking height between the locking member 212 and the ratchet teeth 111. In some embodiments, the disengaging member 31 may abut against the boss 213, and the elastic member 211 may deform to cause the boss 213 to retract toward an axis of the linkage 20. The locking member 212 may disengage from the internal ratchet 11, and the thumbwheel 30 may cause the linkage 20 to rotate. In some embodiments, the disengaging member 31 abuts against the position limiting member 21 to cause elastic deformations. As a result, the stability and reliability are enhanced. As shown in 5, in some embodiments, the thumbwheel 30 may include at least one linkage slot 32. The linkage 20 may include a rotatable boss 22 corresponding to the linkage slot 32. The rotatable boss 22 may be received in the linkage slot 32. When the thumbwheel 30 is rotated, a slot wall of the linkage slot 32 may abut against the rotatable boss 22. Through this configuration, the thumbwheel 30, when rotated, may cause the linkage 20 to rotate. This configuration can sustain a large rotational torque, and can increase the reliability of the connection. By engaging the linkage slot 32 and the rotatable boss 22, the connection location of the linkage slot 32 and the rotatable boss 22 is constant and fixed, which makes the assembling process convenient and consistent. In some embodiments, a rotation space 33 may be provided between the rotatable boss 22 and the linkage slot 32. When the thumbwheel 30 rotates in the rotation space 33, the disengaging member 31 may abut against the position limiting member 21. In some embodiments, the center angle of the rotation space 33 is equal to the center angle of an arc corresponding to the curve along which the disengaging member 31 slides along the elastic member 211 to the boss 213. In some embodiments, a width of the linkage slot 32 is greater than a width of the rotatable boss 22. When the disengaging member 31 is to unlock the position limiting member 21, the thumbwheel 30 rotates along the rotation space 33 until it abuts against a side wall of the rotatable boss 22. In the meantime, the disengaging member 31 rotates to abut against the boss 213, causing the position limiting member 21 to unlock the ratchet teeth 111, which enables to thumbwheel 30 and the linkage 20 to continue to rotate. In some embodiments, the rotation space 33 may provide a space needed for the disengaging member 31 to slide to the boss 213 when the disengaging member 31 unlocks the position limiting member 21. Various components are disposed within the space between the rotatable boss 22 and the linkage slot 32. This arrangement is compact. When the thumbwheel 30 causes the linkage 20 to rotate in another direction, a side wall of the linkage slot 32 directly contacts the rotatable boss 22, causing the linkage 20 to rotate. As shown in 7, the linkage 20 may include an open slot 24 configured to receive the position limiting member 21. The open slot 24 may provide a space for the translation of the position limiting member 21 when the position limiting member 21 is abutted. In some embodiments, the open slot 24 sinks along a longitudinal direction of an outer surface of the linkage 20. The elastic member 211 of the position limiting member 21 may protrude from a side wall of the open slot 24. The extension direction of the elastic member 211 may be along a tangent direction of the linkage 20. Alternatively, the elastic member 211 may tilt on a side wall of the open slot 24. In some embodiments, the boss 213 may protrude toward an outer surface of the linkage 20. A displacement space may be provided between the elastic member 211 and an open slot 24. In some embodiments, a height of the displacement space is greater than a maximum displacement of the boss 213. The configuration of the open slot 24 enables the position limiting member 21 to be disposed in the linkage 20, thereby reducing the overall size of the linkage 20. As a result, the size of the headband may be reduced. As shown in 2, the mounting base 10 may include a mounting shaft 14. An axis of the mounting shaft 14 may coincide with an axis of the internal ratchet 11. In some embodiment, the linkage 20 may be inserted onto the mounting shaft 14. In some embodiment, the mounting shaft 14 may share the same shaft with the internal ratchet 11. In some embodiment, the linkage 20 may be mounted on the mounting shaft 14, and the position limiting member 21 may abut against the internal ratchet 11 to lock it. In some embodiment, when the linkage 20 rotates, the position limiting member 21 may abut against the ratchet teeth 111 one by one, which increases the stability of the rotation for of the linkage 20. In some embodiment, the transmission mechanism 50 may include a first teeth strap 51 and a second teeth strap 52. In some embodiment, the transmission member 23 of the linkage 20 may include a gear 231. The gear 231 may engage with the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52. In some embodiment, the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 may include first meshing teeth 512 and second meshing teeth 522, respectively. In some embodiment, the linkage 20 may cause the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 to extend or retract. In some embodiment, the transmission mechanism 50 may include, but is not limited to, the transmission between the teeth strap and the gear. The transmission mechanism 50 may include other suitable connections, such as connections between a chain and a sprocket, a cam and a follower, and a wheel and a belt, etc. The present disclosure uses the transmission between the teeth strap and the gear as an example to explain the principles of the disclosed technology. In some embodiments, the gear 231 may be meshed with the first meshing teeth 512 and the second meshing teeth 522 simultaneously. The gear 231 may cause the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 to extend or retract in both directions. Because the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 are pivotably connected with two ends of the headband 60 and cannot move, the mounting base 10 may move toward eye glasses body 80 when the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 retract, thereby reducing the volume of the receiving chamber to adjust the headband to fit the user's head with comfort. The mounting base 10 may move away from the eye glasses body 80 when the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 extend, thereby enlarging the volume of the receiving chamber. A user may then take the headband off from the head. The wear and the adjustment of the disclosed headband are convenient. As shown in 2 and 3, in some embodiments, the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 may include a first extended slot 511 and a second extended slot 521, respectively. The first meshing teeth 512 may be disposed in the first extended slot 511, and the second meshing teeth 522 may be disposed in the second extended slot 521. The gear 231 may be meshed with the first meshing teeth 512 and the second meshing teeth 522 simultaneously and respectively. In some embodiments, the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 may be engaged with one another. The gear 231 may pass through the first extended slot 511 and the second extended slot 521 to mesh with the first meshing teeth 512 and the second meshing teeth 522 simultaneously and respectively, thereby reducing the space needed for mounting the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52. This configuration increases the compactness of the device, reduces the overall size of the transmission mechanism 50, and makes it convenient to use in an environment that provides small mounting spaces. In some embodiments, the first meshing teeth 512 are disposed on a longitudinal inner wall of the first extended slot 511, and the second meshing teeth 522 are disposed on a longitudinal inner wall of the second extended slot 521. The first meshing teeth 512 and the second meshing teeth 522 may be located vertically relative to one another to mesh with the gear 231. In some embodiments, the first meshing teeth 512 and the second meshing teeth 522 may be provided on a first inner wall of the first extended slot 511 and the second extended slot 521, respectively. A second inner wall facing the first inner wall on which the first meshing teeth 512 and the second meshing teeth 522 are disposed may be a straight wall. In some embodiments, when the second inner wall tangentially contact the gear 231, the gear 231 is stable and the swing amplitude is small. When only one inner wall is provided with the first meshing teeth 512 and the second meshing teeth 522 vertically relative to each other to mesh with the gear 231, the synchronicity between the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 can be enhanced. The amount of displacement remains the same, and the force distribution on the gear 231 is uniform. This configuration increases the stability of operation of the device. In some embodiments, the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 may be disposed vertically in two directions, and both may be engaged with the gear 231. When the thumbwheel 30 is rotated, the gear 231 may cause the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 to move in opposite directions, thereby adjusting the size , volume of the receiving chamber of the headband to tighten or loosen the headband. As shown in 2 and 3, in some embodiments, a damper 40 may be mounted between the mounting base 10 and the linkage 20. For example, the damper 40 may be mounted between the gear 231 and the mounting base 10. The damper 40 may include a soft rubber material, such as a rubber ring or other types of elastic component. Providing the damper 40 may reduce or eliminate a gap that may be created between the gear 231 and the transmission mechanism 50 during the meshing process, thereby increasing the stability of the rotation. The damper 40 may provide a frictional resistance force, increasing the hand-felt comfort when a user operates the thumbwheel. In some embodiments, the mounting base 10 may include a cover plate 70 located relative to the internal ratchet 11. The cover plate 70 may include a guiding slot 71. The transmission mechanism 50 may be restrained in the guiding slot 71. The cover plate 70 may include a guiding shaft 72. The damper 40 may be mounted on the guiding shaft 72. The gear 231 may be inserted into the first extended slot 511 and the second extended slot 521. The guiding shaft 72 may be inserted into the gear 231 along an axis of the gear 231. The damper 40 may abut against the gear 231. The guiding slot 71 may be disposed on both side of the guiding shaft 72. Two outer walls of the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 are restrained in the guiding slot 71. The gear 231, when rotating, causes the first teeth strap 51 and the second teeth strap 52 to extend or retract along the guiding shaft 72 and the guiding slot 71. This configuration improves the guiding characteristics and the stability of the moving direction. As shown in 9, an example wearable device, such as a wearable video eye glasses, may include an eye glasses body 80 and a headband. The headband may include a headband body 60 connected with the glasses body 80. The eye glasses body 80 may be provided with a video eye glasses body. The headband adjusting device 81 may be provided on the headband body 60. In some embodiments, after being mounted to the headband body 60, the eye glasses body 80 and the headband adjusting device 81 are disposed at two ends of the receiving chamber relative to one another. For example, the eye glasses body 80 may be mounted to a front end of the headband body 60, and the headband adjusting device 81 may be mounted to a rear end of the headband body 60. In operation, the headband may tightly fit onto a user's head. Rotating the headband adjusting device 81 may cause the headband adjusting device 81 to cause the transmission mechanism 50 to extend or retract in both directions. As a result, the mounting base 10 may move to change the size of the receiving chamber. The eye glasses body 80 may be comfortably fitted onto a user's head. The adjustment of the eye glasses body 80 may be conveniently performed using the headband adjusting device 81. The disclosed methods and devices are described in detail.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "As to a lighting and/or signaling device, especially a vehicle lamp of the motor vehicle, the performance thereof is crucial to driving safety of the vehicle. In practice, a vehicle lamp of the motor vehicle typically comprises a LB Low Beam module corresponding to a LB irradiation mode and a HB High Beam module corresponding to a HB irradiation mode, respectively, the LB module functioning as a common basic lighting module for the two irradiation modes while the HB module functioning as an extension lighting module only for the HB irradiation mode. In other words, when the vehicle lamp operates in the LB irradiation mode, only the LB module is turned on to emit light so as to generate a LB light profile; whereas when the vehicle lamp operates in the HB irradiation mode, both the LB module and the HB module are turned on simultaneously to emit light collectively so as to generate a HB light profile. Therefore, it is typically required to adjust the HB module which functions as the extension lighting module so as to implement an accurate optical combination between the LB module and the HB module, to implement the desired HB light profile. In practice, since some process deviations, and stack-up or accumulative tolerances caused by these process deviations collectively, may be created inevitably during manufacturing and assembling processes of products, resulting in a unavoidable problem of a deviation between the final HB light profile and the desired HB light profile. Therefore it is required that the HB module should be adjusted horizontally and vertically to implement an accurate positioning of the HB module so as to diminish or even eliminate said process deviations and said stack-up or accumulative tolerances. However, upon consideration of both horizontal and vertical adjustments on the HB module, since it is difficult to ensure that when one of the horizontal and vertical adjustments is implemented individually, the other one of the horizontal and vertical adjustments is prevented from being influenced correlatively due to a common coupling relationship of the components acted on hereby, it may result in a problem to be solved urgently concerning validity of the adjustments in different directions which may hardly overcome the said process deviations and said stack-up or accumulative tolerances. Hereby, in the prior art, it is imperative to implement horizontal and vertical adjustments onto the HB module individually and independently from each other by an improved regulating device in a lighting and/or signaling system, avoiding mutual interference therebetween while overcoming influence caused by the process deviations and the stack-up or accumulative tolerances during manufacturing and assembling processes effectively, such that there is essentially consistency rather than any deviation between the final HB light profile and the desired HB light profile. Moreover, such an improved regulating device may not increase structural complexity of the lighting and/or signaling system, for facilitating fabrication thereof. In existing lighting device for a motor vehicle, the spatial position of the lighting module in the lighting device usually needs to be adjusted so that the lighting module achieves the desired optical function. The lighting module is connected with the housing of the lighting device through a ball-and-socket structure. Generally, three ball sockets are provided on the lighting module, and three ball heads are provided on three cylindrical rods respectively. The first cylindrical rod is fixedly connected to the housing of the lighting device, and the second and third cylindrical rods are screwed into the threaded holes of the housing of the lighting device. The first cylindrical rod is aligned with the second cylindrical rod in the vertical direction to adjust the pitch angle of the lighting module in a vertical plane. The third cylindrical rod is aligned with the second cylindrical rod in a horizontal direction so as to adjust the orientation of the lighting module in a horizontal plane. In the existing design, the first cylindrical rod and the second cylindrical rod are located close to the housing of the lighting device and the third cylindrical rod is far from the housing of the lighting device due to the structure of the vehicle body. That is, the third cylindrical rod is a long screw screwed into a threaded hole in the housing of the lighting device. The front end of the long screw is provided with a ball head for connection with the ball socket provided on the lighting module. Rotating the long screw can drive the lighting module to move to change its relative spatial position in the lighting device to achieve the adjustment of the lighting module. However, the adjusting screw between the existing lighting module and the housing, which is the third cylindrical rod, is too long, and a long force arm is formed between the lighting module and the housing of the lighting device. When the vehicle vibrates in the up-down direction, the adjusting screw is easily broken or a portion of the housing of the lighting device connected with the adjusting screw is easily damaged. Therefore, there is a need for an adjusting device that can reliably adjust the spatial position of the lighting module. The bezel device of the lighting device of the existing motor vehicle adopts an integrally molded structure. For the reason of appearance, the bezel device consists of a transparent upper bezel and an opaque lower bezel. The transparent upper bezel and the opaque lower bezel are integrally formed by overmolding. A groove extending in the front-rear direction of the vehicle is provided at bottom of the front surface of the transparent upper bezel. The bottom of the groove needs to be coated with an aluminum layer. The portion of the lower bezel adjacent to the upper bezel needs to be coated with an aluminum layer in the left-right direction of the vehicle to improve the appearance of the lighting device. However, the above existing designs have some disadvantages. The groove on the front surface of the upper bezel reaches a depth of 9 mm in the front-rear direction of the vehicle. When an aluminum plating process is carried out on the bottom surface of the groove, any plating layers can not generally be formed on the rear portion of the bottom surface of the groove, to avoid affecting the appearance of the vehicle. In addition, when the portion of the front surface of the lower bezel adjacent to the upper bezel is aluminized, it is necessary to shield the portion of the bezel device that does not require aluminum plating. However, due to process limitations, the boundary between the aluminized and non-aluminized portions of the bezel device is not clear, affecting the appearance of the vehicle. Therefore, there is a need for a bezel device for a lighting device so that the bottom of the groove in the bezel device can be formed with a uniform plating layer and so that the boundary of the aluminum-coated portion in the front surface of the lower bezel is clear, improving the appearance of the lighting device and meeting design requirements. For the lighting and/or signaling device, especially a vehicle lamp of a motor vehicle, the performance thereof is crucial to driving safety of the vehicles. In practice, it is inevitable that the vehicle lamp which functions as a light source may emit heat. As to the heat emitted during operation of the light source, on one hand, an accumulation of the heat inside the vehicle lamp may readily bring about adverse effects on service life of the entire vehicle lamp, resulting in a problem of heat dissipation which is required to be solved urgently; on the other hand, the heat may result in an elevated temperature locally inside the vehicle lamp, and thus produce temperature differences among different regions inside the vehicle lamp. Therefore, when the air humidity rises above a certain level, a phenomenon of condensation may occur in the vehicle lamp. In addition, in consideration of design of style, there may be some dead corners where heat transfer may become relatively slow, which may exacerbate imbalance of temperature distribution in the vehicle lamp. The problem of condensation in the vehicle lamp may be taken into serious consideration since it may weaken illumination and/or signaling effects. As to a problem of heat dissipation of the vehicle lamp as set forth in the first aspect, in the prior art, heat may be absorbed by providing a heat sink at a position where the vehicle lamp is mounted so as to maintain the temperature inside the vehicle lamp at a relative low level, without being influence by excessively high temperature during normal operation. As to a problem of condensation of moisture at the vehicle lamp as set forth in the second aspect, in the prior art, the problem of condensation may be overcome or prevented by providing an anti-fog coating at an appropriate location within the vehicle lamp. However, upon handling of the problems of heat dissipation or preventing condensation by above conventional technical means, there still exist some defects. Above all, the dimension of the heat sink may be relatively large due to design, resulting in a waste of space, such that any mechanism for preventing condensation may not be readily provided additionally in a restricted space. Then, however, there is still a problem of aging or degradation of the anti-fog coating, i. e. , it may fail after a period of time; and the anti-fog coating is provided inside the vehicle lamp, frequently resulting in difficulties in repairing/restoring the anti-fog coating, such that sometime even an entire replacement of the vehicle lamp may be required to solve such a problem, causing an increase in maintenance cost. Next, when handling the problem of heat dissipation, typically, a cooling way of ventilation to the external environment and blowing air towards the light source may be used so as to facilitate heat dissipation of the heat sink. In fact, in operation, the vehicle lamp is heated and thus the gas contained therein may be compressed in a condition without any ventilation thereof. Therefore, ventilation may enable the gas to expand, i. e. , facilitating a pressure equilibrium between inside and outside of the vehicle lamp; however, the existence of ventilation further introduce a problem in that, external moisture may in turn be introduced in the vehicle lamp, which may easily facilitate occurrence of condensation therein. Specifically, the vehicle lamp especially such as a halogen lamp or a xenon lamp and the like, may emit a large amount of heat; while a so-called cold light source , LED light source has semiconductor elements which may emit heat much less than heat of the halogen light source or the xenon light source. Based on above heat difference and shape of transparent covering element of the vehicle lamp , a glass component which has a cold region, then, the larger the area of the cold region is, the less the heating applied onto the transparent covering element may be. In a region of the glass component of the vehicle lamp having a relatively low temperature, a condensation may occur readily at an enclosed glass component. In a condition that the light source has semiconductor elements, such a risk of condensation is even higher, since even though the semiconductor elements are heated, the glass component may not be heated accordingly due to transparency thereof as compared with other light sources. In order to eliminate condensation, it is necessary to introduce moisture into the lighting and/or signaling device upon ventilation, and also a evaporation of the moisture may be promoted. To this end, in the prior art, it is urgently required to solve problems of heat dissipation and avoidance of condensation simultaneously in the lighting and/or signaling system, without increasing complexity of its structure so as to facilitate manufacturing.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described hereinafter in detail with reference to the attached drawings. Throughout the description, the same or similar reference numerals refer to the same or similar elements. The following description of the embodiments of the present disclosure with reference to drawings are intended to explain the generic concept of the present disclosure, instead of being understood as limitation to the present application. According to a general concept of the present disclosure, it provides a regulating assembly for a light source, comprising: a supporting frame, which is coupled in a displaceable manner to the light source; a rotatable fixed regulating portion, which is fixed rotatably at an anchor point on the light source, and is configured to have one rotation degree of freedom at the anchor point; and a horizontal regulating portion and a vertical regulating portion. Each of the horizontal regulating portion and the vertical regulating portion is in a form of a ball-headed screw-thread part and comprises: a rod-shaped body, which is restricted to be movable forwards or backwards only in a corresponding one of a horizontal direction and a vertical direction, and a ball head, which is formed on the rod-shaped body and accommodated within a spherical recess on the supporting frame, the spherical recess being opened partially towards the ball head in the corresponding one of the horizontal direction and the vertical direction. The ball head is configured to be movable only forwards or backwards driven by the rod-shaped body, in the corresponding one of the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, and is further configured to be propped turnably against an inner wall of the spherical recess in a direction deviated from a direction in which the rod-shaped body moves. 1 illustrates a schematic perspective view of a lighting and/or signaling device, comprising a HB module 100 and a LB module 200, as illustrated, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. And 2a and 2b illustrate schematic views of light profiles of a LB irradiation mode and a HB irradiation mode, respectively, in the lighting and/or signaling device as illustrated in 1. Once the vehicle lamp operates in the LB irradiation mode, only the LB module is turned on to emit light so as to generate a LB optical pattern; whereas once the vehicle lamp operates in the HB irradiation mode, both the LB module and the HB module are turned on simultaneously to emit light collectively so as to generate a HB optical pattern. By a comparison between the illustrations of 2a and 2b, it may be seen clearly that, contribution of the HB module to the profile of the HB optical pattern which is formed in the HB irradiation mode by a cooperation between the HB module and the LB module is: a portion of the light profile above an abscissa axis marked by numerals as illustrated in 2b. Therefore, it is typically required to adjust the HB module which functions as the extension lighting module so as to implement an accurate optical combination between the LB module and the HB module, and in turn to implement the desired HB optical pattern. 3 illustrates a schematic isometric perspective view of the HB module 100 and its regulating assembly 1, of the lighting and/or signaling device as illustrated in 1, the regulating assembly 1 comprising a fixed regulating portion 11, a horizontal regulating portion 12 and a vertical regulating portion 13 as illustrated. In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, in consideration that the HB module needs both horizontal and vertical adjustments individually and independently form each other so as to diminish or even eliminate completely the process deviations and the stack-up or accumulative tolerances during manufacturing and assembling processes of products so as to implement a match between the final HB optical pattern and the desired HB optical pattern, as illustrated in 3, the regulating assembly 1 of the HB module 100 may for example comprise a supporting frame 10 disposed thereon which functions as a basic part of the regulating assembly 1. By way of example, the supporting frame is formed as a truss structure, , formed by metal extensions such as steel rebar and the like, its deformations at different locations thereof are considered not to impose any influence on other locations located far away therefrom. The regulating assembly 1 further comprises a fixed regulating portion 11, a horizontal regulating portion 12 and a vertical regulating portion 13, and each of the horizontal regulating portion 12 and the vertical regulating portion 13 may for example be selected to be in a form of a ball-headed screw-thread part which is displaceable linearly along respective axis. As an example, the horizontal regulating portion 12 moves horizontally while the vertical regulating portion 13 moves vertically such that the horizontal regulating portion pushes horizontally and the vertically regulating portion pushes vertically, respectively against corresponding locations on the supporting frame 10 to which they are connected movably. Furthermore, each of the horizontal regulating portion 12 and the vertical regulating portion 13 is provided with a tip of the ball shape which is applicable to rotate freely within a corresponding one of ball sockets formed on the supporting frame 10 of the HB module 100. The supporting frame 10 may be regarded as a common reference for the horizontal regulating portion 12 and the vertical regulating portion 13, at an anchor point where the fixed regulating portion is seated, and the fixed regulating portion 11 is constructed to adjust the supporting frame 10 , by a reference regulating screw-thread part 11 disposed adjacent to the fixed regulating portion , by turning a regulating nut, such as a hexagonal screw nut and the like, for facilitating the adjustment, so as to compensate respective rotations of the horizontal regulating portion 12 and the vertical regulating portion 13 at the tip of the ball shape thereof. Essentially, as illustrated in 3, the fixed regulating portion 11 is for example fixed at a certain point, , all translational degrees of freedom thereof have been restricted. The fixed regulating portion 11 may also be constructed to be in a form of a ball-head shape, and configured to be fitted with a ball-head retaining member provided adjacent thereto on the supporting frame 10 of the HB module 100 such that the fixed regulating portion 11 can cooperate with the ball-head retaining member and have a rotational degree of freedom in situ. Furthermore, as illustrated in 4a to 4c, 4a illustrates a schematic isometric perspective view of the lighting and/or signaling device and its regulating assembly 1 as illustrated in 3, a cutting line on the horizontal regulating portion 12 being shown therein; 4b illustrates a schematic sectional view of the horizontal regulating portion 12 as illustrated in 4a which is taken along a line A-A; and 4c illustrates a schematic view of an operation condition of the horizontal regulating portion 12 as illustrated in 4b. In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, especially as illustrated in above figures, from the section taken along the line A-A in 4b, it can be known that, taking the horizontal regulating portion 12 as an example, the horizontal regulating portion 12 comprises a ball-headed screw-thread part 121 which functions as a key regulating component. The ball-headed screw-thread pan 121 further includes a regulating ball head 123 and a screw-threaded part body 124 which is for example a screw-threaded rod formed integrally with the regulating ball head 123 at the tip of the horizontal regulating portion. The screw-threaded part body 124 is installed on a stationary horizontal regulating fixture support 122 throughout a channel formed therein, and is restricted hereby correspondingly to be displaceable horizontally by turning it, , at a base portion of the screw-threaded part body 124. For facilitating the turning operation, the base portion of the screw-threaded part body 124 is for example formed to have a shrunk sectional shape. With such shrunk sectional shape, the base portion is easier to be turned by a hand directly. Alternatively, with such shrunk sectional shape, a hexagonal nut may be easier to be mounted around the base portion for increasing the friction force applied by hand so as to turn the base portion conveniently by applying a force on the nut. The horizontal regulating fixture support 122 may for example be secured to the lighting and/or signaling device and then may be considered to be stationary. In an embodiment, the regulating ball head 123 may for example be pivotably accommodated within a ball socket 1001 , in a form of the ball-head retaining member, as illustrated formed on the supporting frame 10. Specifically, by way of example, as illustrated in 4b, the regulating ball head 123 may for example be pivotably accommodated within a spherical recess 10012 which is formed in the ball socket 1001 and arranged to face towards the ball head 123, and the ball socket 1001 further includes a protruding portion which expands outwards from the periphery of the spherical recess 10012 so as to conveniently guide the regulating ball head 123 from outside thereof into the spherical recess 10012 appropriately in place. Thereby, when it is required to regulate the HB module horizontally, by turning the screw-threaded part body 124 , turning the hexagonal nut which may be optionally provided on the base portion of the screw-threaded part body, the screw-threaded part body 124 may pass through the channel within the horizontal regulating fixture support 122 in the horizontal direction so as to travel forward or backward correspondingly to drive the regulating ball head 123 to move forward or backward, and the regulating ball head 123 may in turn drive the supporting frame 10 horizontally due to a movable fit with the spherical recess 10012 of the ball socket 1001 formed on the supporting frame 10, so as to regulate horizontal positions of the HB module to which the frame 10 is coupled. Certainly, correspondingly, in consideration of the process deviations and the stack-up or accumulative tolerances during manufacturing and assembling processes, the regulating ball head 123 may not necessarily be received within the spherical recess 10012 horizontally, and hence a pushing or pulling action may not necessarily be applied thereon strictly in the horizontal direction, such that in this condition a slight lateral displacement or turning of the whole supporting frame 10 may be caused hereby. Furthermore, in consideration of the fixed regulating portion 11 which is installed at the anchor point in the regulating assembly, it may only rotate in situ since it is only provided with the single rotational degree of freedom but restricted at all translational degrees of freedom thereof. Therefore, the fixed regulating portion 11 may be adjusted correspondingly to drive the supporting frame 10 in motion, , by turning the adjacent nut correspondingly, to conduct a rotation which may be opposite to an undesired movement of the frame 10 , turning it resulting from the adjustment of the horizontal regulating portion 12. In this way, in the adjustment for the compensation in the horizontal direction, the undesired movement of the frame 10 caused by the process deviations and the stack-up or accumulative tolerances during manufacturing and assembling processes may be counteracted; i. e. , an independent horizontal adjustment may be obtained, without imposing any impact on the vertical regulating portion 13. The undesired turning caused by aforementioned horizontal adjustment and the compensation therefor can be shown in 4c. Similarly, an adjustment on the HB module in the vertical direction is further taken into consideration. The vertical regulating portion 13 may also be in a form of a ball-headed screw-thread part. Moreover, the vertical regulating portion 13 is for example selected to be in the same form of the ball-headed screw-thread part as that of the horizontal regulating portion 12 as illustrated in 4b, except that the vertical regulating portion is arranged vertically. Due to the process deviations and the stack-up or accumulative tolerances during manufacturing and assembling, processes, the regulating ball head of the vertical regulating portion 13 may not necessarily be received within a corresponding spherical recess vertically, and hence a pushing or pulling action on the corresponding spherical recess which is arranged vertically may not necessarily be applied strictly in the vertical direction, such that in this condition a slight lateral displacement or turning of the whole supporting frame 10 may be caused hereby. Furthermore, in consideration of the fixed regulating portion 11 which is installed at the anchor point in the regulating assembly 1, it may only rotate in situ since it is only provided with the single rotational degree of freedom but restricted to lack all translational degrees of freedom thereof. Therefore, the fixed regulating portion 11 may be adjusted correspondingly to drive the supporting frame 10 in motion, , by turning the adjacent nut correspondingly, to conduct a rotation which may be opposite to an undesired movement of the frame 10 , turning it resulting from the adjustment of the vertical regulating portion 13. In this way, in the adjustment for the compensation in the vertical direction, the undesired movement of the frame 10 caused by the process deviations and the stack-up or accumulative tolerances during manufacturing and assembling processes may be counteracted; i. e. , an independent vertical adjustment may be obtained, without imposing any impact on the horizontal adjustment of the horizontal regulating portion 12. The undesired turning caused by aforementioned vertical adjustment and the compensation therefor can be similar to that as shown in 4c. In the above embodiments of the present disclosure, the horizontal regulating portion and the vertical regulating portion such as the ball-headed screw-thread part and the like, and the fixed regulating portion located at the anchor point are adopted, which are associated mutually by a frame provided between the fixed regulating portion and the horizontal regulating portion and the vertical regulating portion; the horizontal regulating portion and the vertical regulating portion may provide the horizontal adjustment and the vertical adjustment respectively, while the fixed regulating portion located at the anchor point is also regulated to offset or overcome the undesired movement of the frame caused by the process deviations and the stack-up or accumulative tolerances, so as to implement the compensation for kinematic errors, resulting in an independent and accurate horizontal adjustment and vertical adjustment. The lighting and/or signaling device of the present disclosure may be vehicle lamp of a motor vehicle or a non-motor vehicle. In another aspect of the present disclosure, the lighting and/or signaling, device is also provided, comprising the HB module, the LB module and the regulating assembly as described above. The lighting and/or signaling device also has the above advantages of the regulating assembly correspondingly. The details on the above advantages will be omitted herein. 5 is a perspective view of a lighting device 1000 equipped with an adjusting device 1200 for adjusting the lighting module 1100 in the lighting device 1000 according to the present disclosure.

A guide groove 1310 is provided on an inner surface of the housing, and the guide groove 1310 is engaged with the guide rail 1242 of the slider 1240 so that the guide rail 1242 can freely slide in the guide groove 1310 in the front and rear direction of the motor vehicle.

The slider 1240 is disposed within the housing 1300 and has a guide rail 1242 provided on a bottom surface 1241 of the slider 1240. The guide rail 1242 extends in the front and rear direction of the motor vehicle. A guide groove 1310 is provided on an inner surface of the housing 1300 and cooperates with the guide rail 1242 of the slider 1240 so that the guide rail 1242 is freely slidable within the guide groove 1310 only in the front and rear direction of the motor vehicle while prevented from moving in the vertical and left and right directions of the vehicle. A ball head 1231 is provided at the front end of the adjusting screw 1230 and a ball socket 1243 is provided on a first side of the slider 1240 adjacent to the front end of the adjusting screw 1230. The ball head 1231 on the adjusting screw 1230 cooperates with the ball socket 1243 on the slider 1240, so that the slider 1240 can move in the front-rear direction within the guide groove 1310, driven by the adjusting screw 1230. It should be noted that the ball-and-socket connection between the front end of the adjusting screw 1230 and the slider 1240 is able to compensate for errors formed in the manufacturing process. Such a connection also may change the position and orientation of the adjusting screw 1230 with respect to the slider 1240 when the design of the screw 1230 and the slider 1240 are limited by structures or space, even if the adjusting screw 1230 is not arranged so that its central axis is parallel to the front-and-rear sliding direction of the slider 1240. A ball head 1244 is disposed on a second side of the slider 1240 opposite to the first side, and a ball socket 1101 is disposed on the lighting module. The ball head 1244 on the slider 1240 cooperates with the ball socket 1101 on the lighting module 1100 so that the lighting module 1100 can be moved in the space within the lighting device 1000, driven by the slider 1240. As an example, the guide rail 1242 may be complementary in shape to the guide groove 1310. This can improve the cooperation between them. As shown in 6 and 8, in the present embodiment, the guide rail 1242 is an inverted T-shaped portion 1242, and the guide groove 1310 is an inverted T-shaped groove. The use of an inverted T-shaped structure simplifies the manufacturing process of the guide rail 1242 and the guide groove 1310 while the strength of the guide rail 1242 and the strength of the guide groove 1310 are ensured. The guide groove 1310 is formed by a first wall 1320 and a second wall 1330 which are protruded from the inner surface of the housing 1300 and are symmetrical with respect to the central plane of the guide groove 1310. The central plane is a vertical plane that is parallel to the front and rear direction of the vehicle. The first wall 1320 and the second wall 1330 each include: a first section 1321, 1331 extending vertically from an inner surface of the housing 1300 and perpendicular to an inner surface of the housing 1300; a second section 1322, 1332 extending parallel to the inner surface of the housing 1300 from an end of the first section 1321, 1331 facing away from the inner surface of the housing 1300 towards the central plane; and a third section 1323, 1333 extending parallel to the first section 1321, 1331 in a direction away from the inner surface of the housing 1300 from an end of the second section 1322, 1332 near the central plane. The guide groove 1310 of the above structure will not increase the overall thickness of the housing. It only needs to form the first wall 1320 and the second wall 1330 at the position where the guide groove 1310 needs to be provided. After the lighting device 1000 is assembled, the relative position relation of the lighting module 1100, the adjusting screw 1230, the slider 1240 and the housing 1300 is shown in 7. When the relative spatial position of the lighting module 1100 within the housing 1300 is adjusted, the adjusting screw 1230 is turned by means of a conventional adjusting tool such as a screwdriver so that the adjusting screw 1230 moves relative to the housing 1230 in the front and rear direction. The front and rear movement of the adjusting screw 1230 drives the slider 1240 to move within the guide groove 1310 on the housing 1300 in the front and rear direction through the ball head 1231 and the ball socket 1243. The front and rear movement of the slider 1240 in turn causes the lighting module 1100 to pivot about a vertical axis defined by the first connecting bar 1210 and the second connecting bar 1220 through the ball head 1244 and the ball socket 1101, thereby adjusting the orientation of the lighting module 1100 in the horizontal plane. The use of the ball head 1244 and the ball socket 1101 further overcomes manufacturing and assembling errors, ensuring the reliability and the flexible position adjustment of the lighting module 1100. In an example, the guide groove 1310 is a dovetail groove, and the guide rail 1242 has a shape complementary to the shape of the guide groove 1310. Complementary shapes of dovetail grooves allow a tight fitting. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a vertical section of the inverted T-shaped portion 1242 of the slider 1240 may further include a recessed portion 1245 formed on a lower surface of the inverted T-shaped portion. This enables the inverted T-shaped portion 1242 of the slider 1240 to be stably supported in the guide groove 1310 on the housing 1300. The slider 1240 may also be hollowed out so that the slider 1240 may be integrally formed by an injection molding process. The above description with reference to the drawings describes that the slider and the housing realize a movement in the front and rear direction of vehicle only by the T-shaped structure. However, those skilled in the art may understand that the present disclosure is not limited thereto, and any structure that achieves its corresponding function will fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure. For example, the slider and the housing can also realize the horizontal and vertical position stopping functions through the dovetail groove, and at the same time, the movement of the slider in the front and rear direction is ensured. The present disclosure further provides a lighting device, which includes the adjusting device for the lighting module according to the present disclosure. The present disclosure further provides a motor vehicle, which includes the above lighting device. With the adjusting device of the lighting module and the lighting device according to the present disclosure, the length of the third adjusting screw which results in a suspended state of the lighting module in the lighting device is shortened, and the length of the force arm generated by the lighting module relative to the housing of the lighting device is reduced. The possibility of damage to the screw and the housing can be effectively reduced when they are subject to vibration in the vertical direction and the reliability of the lighting device is improved. 9 is a perspective view of the bezel device 3000 according to the embodiment of the present disclosure in which a part of the top bezel 3100 is inserted into the main bezel 3200. The bezel device 3000 may for example be used in a lighting device. The bezel device 3000 includes a top bezel 3100 and a main bezel 3200. The top bezel 3100 has a flat plate-like body 3101, for example, a horizontal flat plate-like body 3101. The main bezel 3200 includes a first bezel 3210 and a second bezel 3220. The present disclosure will be described below in detail with reference to an example in which the first bezel 3210 is a transparent upper bezel and the second bezel 3220 is an opaque lower bezel 3220. A main hole 3230 for receiving a lighting module of the lighting device is formed in the lower bezel 3220. The lower bezel 3220 has a top plate 3221 extending in the first direction above the main hole 3230. The top plate 3221 is horizontal, for example. The first direction is, for example, is the rearward direction of the vehicle. The upper bezel 3210 is connected to the lower bezel 3220 at the front edge of the top plate 3221 and extends upward in front of the front edge. The lower surface of the upper bezel 3210 is flush with the lower surface of the top plate 3221 of the lower bezel 3220. The top bezel 3100 is fixedly connected to the upper bezel 3210 and the lower bezel 3220 by a clipping device such that the upper surface of the flat plate-like body 3101 of the top bezel 3100 is in contact with the lower surface of the horizontal top plate 3221 of the lower bezel 3220. The top bezel 3100 and the main bezel 3200 will be specifically described below with reference to 10 to 15. 10 is a top view of the assembled bezel device 3000 shown in 9; 11 is a top view of the top bezel 3100 of the bezel device 3000 shown in 9; 12 is a top view of the main bezel 3200 of the bezel device 3000 shown in 9; 13 is a cross-sectional view taken along line I-I and line II-II in 10; 14 is a partially enlarged view of area A in 10; and 15 is a cross-sectional view taken along line III-III of an assembled bezel device 3000 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The clipping device between the top bezel 3100 and the main bezel 3200 includes a first stop device, a second stop device, a third stop device and a fourth stop device. The first stop device includes: at least one groove 3211 provided on one side surface, such as the front surface, of the upper bezel 3210 and at least one barb 3102 provided at a position of the top bezel 3100 corresponding to the groove 3211. The groove 3211 extends in a first direction, and the barb 3102 can cover the entire lower surface of the groove 3211. After the top bezel 3100 is assembled to the main bezel 3200, the barb 3102 visually forms a part of the groove on the upper bezel 3210 such that the bottom of the groove formed by the upper bezel 3210 and the top bezel 3100 can exhibit a uniform layer of aluminum. According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, an aluminum layer is coated on outer surface of the barb 3102, so that the bezel device 3000 presents a good optical appearance. The barb 3102 engages with the groove 3211 such that the top bezel 3100 is prevented from moving in the first direction with respect to the main bezel 3200. In accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure, the outer surface of the barb 3102 that can be viewed from the exterior of the vehicle is coated with an aluminum layer. The second stop device includes an arc-shaped protrusion 3103 disposed on the upper surface of the flat plate-like main body 3101 of the top bezel 3100 and two resilient arms 3222 disposed in the top plate 3221 of the lower bezel 3220. The arc-shaped protrusion 3103 has an apex and two ends facing a third direction. For example, in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the third direction is a forward direction of the vehicle opposite to the first direction. The end surfaces of the two end portions are parallel to the second direction of the vehicle and perpendicular to the upper surface of the flat plate-like main body 3101 of the top bezel 3100. The second direction is perpendicular to the first direction. The second direction is, for example, the left-right direction of the vehicle. The two resilient arms 3222 are bridged in parallel in the first direction of the vehicle in a first hole 3224 penetrating through the top plate 3221 in the thickness direction of the top plate 3221. Each of the resilient arms is provided with a lateral protrusion 3223 extending towards the other resilient arm. The lateral protrusion 3223 has a rear surface extending parallel to the left and right direction of the vehicle and perpendicular to the upper surface of the top plate and an inclined surface that is inclined at an angle to the first direction and extends perpendicular to the upper surface of the top plate. When assembled, the arc-shaped protrusion 3103 moves in the first direction from the front of the lateral protrusion 3223 and the arc-shaped surface on two sides of the apex of the arc-shaped protrusion 3103 forces the lateral protrusions 3223 and the resilient arms 3222 to move away from the apex of the arc-shaped protrusion 3103 in the leftwards direction and the rightwards direction, respectively. When the arc-shaped protrusion 3103 is further moved in the first direction, two ends of the arc-shaped protrusion 3103 passes across the lateral protrusions 3223, and the two lateral protrusions 3223 return to their initial positions under the action of the resilient arms 3222. At this time, the end surface of each arc-shaped protrusion 3103 cooperates with the rear surface of the corresponding lateral protrusion 3223 so that the movement of the top bezel 3100 in the third direction with respect to the main bezel 3200 is prevented. The third stop device includes a second hole 3225 formed in the top plate 3221 of the lower bezel 3220 and an plate-like inclined portion 3104 inclined from the upper surface of the plate-like main body 3101 of the top bezel 3100 toward the top plate 3221 substantially in the first direction. The second hole 3225 penetrates through the top plate 3221 in the thickness direction of the top plate 3221. When the top bezel 3100 is assembled to the main bezel 3200, the plate-like inclined portion 3104 passes upward through the second hole 3225 in the top plate 3221 and cooperates with the edge , rear edge of the second hole 3225, so as to prevent the top bezel 3100 from moving in the third direction relative to the main bezel 3200. The fourth stop device includes: a rib 3105 provided on an upper surface of a flat plate-like main body 3101 of the top bezel 3100 and extending in the left and right direction of the vehicle; and a finger 3227 extending in the first direction from a first edge front edge of a third hole 3226 provided in the top plate 3221 of the lower bezel 3220. There is a space between the finger 3227 and a second edge rear edge of the third hole 3226 opposite to the first edge such that when the top bezel 3100 is assembled to the main bezel 3200, the rib 3105 on the upper surface of the flat plate-like main body 3101 of the top bezel 3100 is accommodated in the space. When the top bezel 3100 is assembled to the main bezel 3200, the rib 3105 cooperates with the finger 3227 such that the top bezel 3100 is prevented from moving in the third direction relative to the main bezel 3200. According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, a stop device similar to the third stop device may also be formed on the rear edge of the third hole 3226, as shown in 14. Also, as an example, only one of the other types of stop device described above is shown in the drawings, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that more stop devices having the same configuration may be provided as desired. For example, a plurality of grooves 3211, for example, six grooves, may be provided on the front surface of the upper bezel 3210 while the same number of barbs 3102 are provided on the top bezel 3100. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the upper bezel 3210 and the lower bezel 3220 are integrally formed, for example, integrally formed by overmolding so that the manufacturing of the bezel device 3000 is simplified. The upper bezel 3210 and the lower bezel 3220 can be firmly fixed together. An embodiment in which an aluminum layer is coated on the surface of the top bezel that can be seen from the exterior of the vehicle has been described with reference to the accompanying drawings, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that all outer surfaces of the top bezel may be coated with the aluminum layer. In this way, the masking step in the manufacturing of the top bezel is eliminated, simplifying the aluminum plating process. The embodiment in which the top plate 3221 of the top bezel 3220 is a flat plate has been described with reference to the drawings, but those skilled in the art will understand that the thickness of the portion associated with the function of the clipping device may be slightly changed depending on the strength requirement of the stop device without departing from the scope of protection of the present disclosure. Although the positioning of the top bezel 3100 in the left and right direction of the vehicle is not explicitly mentioned in the above embodiment, the cooperation of the barb 3102 with the groove 3211 and the cooperation of the plate-like inclined portion 3104 and the second hole 3225 objectively make it possible to prevent the top bezel 3100 from moving in the left and right direction of the vehicle. Moreover, the top bezel 3100 may also be prevented from moving in the left and right direction of the vehicle by means of other mechanisms provided on the top bezel 3100 and the main bezel 3200, such as a positioning pin provided on the side surface of the top bezel 3100 and a positioning hole provided on the main bezel 3200. In addition, the cooperation of the barb 3102 with the groove 3211 and the cooperation of the plate-like inclined portion 3104 with the second hole 3225 can also prevent the top bezel 3100 from moving in the up and down direction of the vehicle. When the bezel device 3000 according to the present disclosure is assembled, the top bezel 3100 is at first placed in the main hole 3230 of the main bezel 3200. When the arc-shaped protrusion 3103 and the plate-like inclined portion 3104 respectively reach the front of the lateral protrusions 3223 in the corresponding first hole 3224 and the position of the second hole 3225, the top bezel 3100 is lifted upwards so that the arc-shaped protrusion 3103 and the plate-like inclined portion 3104 enter the first hole 3224 and the second hole 3225, respectively, and so that the barb 3102 and the groove 3211 are aligned with each other. Then, the top bezel 3100 is pushed rearward so that the barb 3102 is engaged with the groove 3211. The end surface of each arc-shaped protrusion 3103 is engaged with the rear surface of the corresponding lateral protrusion 3223. The plate-like inclined portion 3104 passes upwardly through the second hole 3225 in the top plate 3221 and is engaged with the rear edge of the second hole 3225, and the rib 3105 is engaged with the finger 3227. After thus assembled, movement of the top bezel 3100 with respect to the main bezel 3200, for example, in the front and rear direction, the left and right direction, and the up and down direction of the motor vehicle can be prevented. The present disclosure further provides a lighting device including the above bezel device, for example, a lighting device for a motor vehicle. The present disclosure further provides a motor vehicle including the above lighting device. With the bezel device, the lighting device and the motor vehicle according to the present disclosure, the bezel device is formed as two parts, i. e. , the main bezel and the top bezel. By aluminizing only the top bezel and forming the portion to be aluminized after the top bezel is assembled with the main bezel, the aluminum plating of the bottom surface of the groove in the upper bezel is easily achieved, and the boundary of the aluminized portion is clear, and the appearance of the vehicle are greatly improved. At the same time, the problem that the top bezel and the main bezel are thin and it is difficult to fix the top bezel by screws is overcome by means of the plurality of clipping devices, thereby reliably connecting the top bezel and the main bezel of the thin plate structure without screws. Moreover, the use of the clipping device enables the main bezel and the top bezel of the bezel device to form a close and firm contact between contact faces of them. In this way, it may also avoid the possibility of destroying the aluminum layer on the top bezel and the surface of the transparent upper bezel due to such as screw or welding connection and further destroying the appearance of the bezel device,According to a general technical concept of the present disclosure, it provides a gas guiding device for a lighting and/or signaling device, comprising: a gas channel, which extends in the gas guiding device and has two ends, one of the two ends being opened to one or more readily condensable locations of the lighting and/or signaling device; and a flow guiding component, which is disposed between the other end of the two ends of the gas channel and a heat sink of the lighting and/or signaling device, and is provided with an air inlet side located immediately adjacent to and in fluid communication with the other end of the gas channel and an air outlet side located upstream of the heat sink and facing towards the heat sink, wherein the flow guiding component is configured to extract an air flow at the air inlet side and to blow the air flow towards the air outlet side; and wherein the gas channel is arranged to guide at least a portion of the air flow by the extraction of the flow guiding, component to flow through the one or more readily condensable locations of the lighting and/or signaling device. 16 illustrates a schematic perspective view of a lighting and/or signaling device 400 and a front shell containing the same, and a gas guiding device used for it, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, , illustrating a plurality of light sources 4001 such as LED modules and the like and a flow guiding component 1 , a fan for guiding the gas , air to flow in a direction facing towards the light sources 4001, as well as a gas channel for guiding a flow of an ambient gas , air along a flow path different from that defined by the flow guiding component. The light source 4001, , LED modules, may be configured to emit light so as to implement a functionality of lighting and/or signaling. Although merely a single light source is illustrated in 16, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that, embodiments of the present disclosure are not be limited thereto; and alternatively, two or more light sources may be adopted for meeting different requirements of lighting and/or signaling. The light source 4001 may be contained in a lamp shell thereof. In particular, other optical components , a mirror and/or a structure for meeting requirement of style design of the light thus emitted may also be contained within the lamp shell, besides the light source 4001. On one hand, as illustrated in 16, by way of example, a fan 4 is used to extract air at its air inlet side or adjacent to the air inlet side forcibly and to guide the air to flow at the air outlet side, in a predetermined flow path , as illustrated in 16, for extracting air flow at a lower side of the fan which corresponds to the air inlet side of the flow guiding component and blowing air upwards so as to guide the air flow towards the light source 4001. And further in view of 17, which illustrates an enlarged schematic view of the lighting and/or signaling device of the embodiment as illustrated in 16, at an airflow suction portion located at a lower right corner thereof, showing that a heat sink 41 provided at the light source 4001 of the lighting and/or signaling device 400. As such, air extracted by the fan 4 directly at the lower side thereof, i. e. , at the air inlet side, is blown upwards to the heat sink 41 provided at the light source 4001, so as to have two effects as below: firstly, an airflow at surfaces of the heat sink 41 may be accelerated so as to facilitate a diffusion of heat emitted by the light source to the airflow flowing around the heat sink swiftly so as to accelerate heat dissipation and to ensure normal operation of the light source; secondly, the air surrounding around the light source within the lamp shell may be forced to flow in the predetermined flow path i. e. , in a direction extending from the fan 4 towards the light source 4001 and the heat sink 41, as illustrated in 16 and 17 so as to balance a temperature distribution around the light source, i. e. , to prevent an imbalance of the temperature distribution at or adjacent to the position of the light source. However, embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to this. Even if the predetermined flow path for blowing air towards the heat sink 41 of the light source by the fan 4 fails to pass directly through the heat sink 41 and the light source 4001 , a condition in which the flow path for blowing air by the fan 4 may not be configured to flow through the heat sink directly, due to a restriction of spatial dimension and shape, it is still possible to arrange the flow path for blowing air to flow over surfaces of components and parts which are in a thermal-conductive contact with the heat sink, facilitating airflow around them, so as to obtain an effect of reducing temperature differences among different locations in proximity thereof and to facilitate heat dissipation indirectly. It should be noticed that, in practice, the light source 4001 may not necessarily be a location where the temperature is highest, especially in a condition that a cold light source, , LED, is adopted, an external heat source outside the vehicle lamp , heat emitted by a motor or a temperature rise caused by illumination of sun ray, and the like may result in the imbalance of temperature distribution around the light source inside the lamp shell, for example. The flowpath for blowing air by the fan 4 may hereby ensure heat dissipation in these circumstances, its details will be omitted herein. On the other hand, two fundamental conditions for producing a phenomenon of condensation are temperature difference and air humidity. Once there is the imbalance of temperature distribution due to a local temperature rise inside the lamp shell and humidity of air is above at a certain level, then a condensation may occur at a local part where there is a relatively low temperature. In the present disclosure, since at the lighting and/or signaling device 400, its outer lens portion may typically function as a light emergent interface with ambient air, i. e. , the lighting and/or signaling device 400 and the ambient air are located on both sides of the interface, respectively. Therefore, such interface is a region highly risking in producing the condensation readily; in other words, it is also a region of interest in the disclosure where the condensation is desired to be avoided, so as to avoid any effect on emergent light of the lighting and/or signaling device. Correspondingly, 20 illustrates a schematic front view of a back chamber shell which is installed to a back side of the lighting and/or signaling device shown in 16 and 17 by snap-fit thereon, and an interior space defined in the chamber shell, as well as the components and parts installed therein. It is observed from aforementioned lighting and/or signaling device and the flow guiding component provided in the device, towards the interior of a body of the vehicle. In view of illustrations of 16, 17 and 20, the lighting and/or signaling device 400 and the front shell containing the lighting and/or signaling device 400 as illustrated in 16 is engaged with the back chamber shell 500 which is installed from a back side thereof by snap-fit as illustrated in 20, so as to form a seal, hence a completed inner chamber is essentially defined between them, in which an internal circulation of air may occur. Furthermore, as illustrated in 20, the complete inner chamber is provided with a plurality of ventilation holes at the back chamber shell 500, which ventilation holes are in communication with the external environment, , four ventilation holes 5001, 5001, 5001, 5001, each of which has one end opened directly to the inside of the back chamber shell 500 facing towards the lighting and/or signaling device located at the front side relative thereto especially inside of the outer lens portion at the region in which there is high risk of producing the condensation, and the other end communicating with external environment , via a pipe 5002 which leads outwards. And preferably, each of the plurality of ventilation holes is for example configured to be a hole which is normally closed and may be opened unidirectionally once acted on by a positive pressure difference between an internal pressure and an external atmosphere pressure. Therefore, in an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, as illustrated in 18a, 19 and 20, in particular, 18a illustrates a schematic front perspective view of the lighting and/or signaling device and the gas guiding device used for it as illustrated in 16, the gas guiding device extracting gas at the airflow suction portion located at the lower right corner thereof; 19 illustrates a schematic back view of a gas channel of the gas guiding device as illustrated in 16 to 18, and a surface of lens which is in contact with the gas channel. By way of example, the airflow which is blown by the fan 4, may forcibly flow through a gas channel 5 arranged at a downstream side of the fan facing towards a surface of the outer lens, or may flow actively through an alternative gas channel 5 placed alongside the surface of the outer lens. As such, by accelerating the airflow at the surface of the outer lens so as to carry out air molecules having relatively high humidity at the surface of the outer lens and to accelerate elimination of the phenomenon of condensation, and the temperature difference may be inhibited by bringing away the heat accumulated locally inside the outer lens with the airflow so as to prevent phenomenon of condensation from being produced, or eliminate the phenomenon of condensation rapidly if it is presented. To be specific, as illustrated in 18a, when the air extracted in by the fan 4 is blown towards the inside of the inner chamber, at least one portion or most of the air may be blown towards the heart sink 41 so as to produce main heat dissipation effect for the lighting and/or signaling device 400, and may for example be exhausted at the heat sink as illustrated in 17, to a back portion of the inner chamber defined by the back chamber shell 500 as in 20, while another portion thereof may be deflected and guided at an interface between a passageway located downstream of the fan and the gas channel 5, by a wall portion 51 of the gas channel 5 , an upper wall portion as illustrated in 18a so as to be guided into the gas channel 5 i. e. , the wall portion 51 functions as an inlet of the gas channel, i. e. , may be referring to as first channel inlet hereinafter, and may continue to be pushed further into the gas channel 5. The gas channel 5 is arranged circuitously depending on profiles of internal components and parts inside the lighting and/or signaling device 400 and spaces among the components and parts, to form a plurality of corners therein at relatively small angles inclined among walls of the gas channel and to point generally towards the surface of the outer lens, which function as the region of interest highly risking in producing the condensation readily, for example, and also arranged to open outwards at an uttermost/terminal end 22 referred to as first channel outlet provided after the surface of the outer lens so as to exhaust air therefrom, such that the air may continue to diffuse to fill the back portion of the inner chamber defined in the back chamber shell 500 as illustrated in 20; therefore, such a configuration may avoid excessively large loss in momentum of air. Preferably, except for reduced cross sections provided at downstream sides adjacent to several corners, cross sections of the gas channel 5 at other locations have the substantially same dimension and shape, so as to take advantage of the Bernoulli principle to accelerate airflow to ensure that a flow rate of the airflow of air subsequently arriving at the surface of the outer lens is substantially consistent. Moreover, the airflow which has entered the back portion of the inner chamber defined in the back chamber shell 500 as illustrated in 20, may continue to flow so as to implement an internal circulation thereof. And in condition that there is a positive pressure difference created when the internal pressure is larger as compared with the external atmosphere pressure , due to the fact that air is continuously extracted into inside of the inner chamber such that the internal pressure exceeds the external atmosphere pressure, or a thermal balance/equilibrium is destroyed in the inner chamber relative to the external environment such that a positive pressure difference is thus created relative to the external environment, then the ventilation holes 5001, 5001, 5001, 5001 which are normally closed and may be opened unidirectionally once they are acted on by a positive pressure difference between the internal pressure and the external atmosphere pressure, may be in communication with the external environment and exhaust gas therethrough, until the thermal balance and an equilibrium in pressure are both recovered in the inner chamber relative to the external environment. In conclusion, in the embodiment as illustrated in 18a, the flow guiding component such as the fan and the like, may be configured to split the airflow of incoming air by cooperation with the upper wall portion of the gas channel 5 arranged alongside, such that one portion of the airflow of the incoming air may travel over the flow guiding component in a direction pointing directly towards the heat sink, while another portion of the airflow of the incoming air may be blown by the flow guiding component and deflected and guided by the upper wall portion so as to travel into the gas channel 5. As such, a two-way flow splitting functionality of the fan 4 which functions as the flow guiding component is implemented. And in an alternative embodiment of the disclosure, as illustrated in 18b and 19, 18b illustrates a schematic front perspective view of the lighting and/or signaling device and the gas guiding device used for it, as illustrated in 16, and by way of example, the gas guiding device may alternatively extract gas, by the fan 4 located downstream, from air within the inner chamber, especially the back portion of the inner chamber defined by the back chamber shell 500 as illustrated in 20, via an airflow suction portion i. e. , referred to as second channel inlet, as indicated by reference numeral 52 as illustrated located at an upper left corner thereof. And for example, the airflow, which is extracted from the inner chamber by the extraction of the fan 4 located downstream and then through the airflow suction portion of the gas channel, may travel over the surface of the lens above all and then be guided from the second channel inlet 52 so as to flow actively towards the fan 4. As such, by accelerating the airflow at the surface of the outer lens so as to carry out air molecules having relatively high humidity at the surface of the outer lens and to accelerate elimination of the phenomenon of condensation, and the temperature difference may be inhibited by bringing away the heat accumulated locally inside of the outer lens with the airflow which enters subsequently and continuously so as to/restrain there, then the phenomenon of condensation may be prevented in advance, or be eliminated swiftly if it is presented. Specifically, as illustrated in 18b, with the suction/extraction of the fan 4 located downstream, when the airflow which is in the back portion of the inner chamber defined by the back chamber shell 500 as illustrated in 20, is extracted into the gas channel at a distal end thereof , referred to as second channel inlet, as indicated at reference numeral 52 as illustrated, and the delivered forcibly towards the fan 4 which may be considered to be arranged downstream thereof all of the airflow thus introduced may be exhausted via a channel outlet which is referred to as second channel outlet 51 provided adjacent to the fan 4, and deflected against and guided by a wall portion referred to as lower wall portion enclosed at a lower side of the fan 4, outside the gas channel, so as to enter the gas channel 5, i. e. , the wall portion 51 functions as an initiating point of a flow path of the airflow towards the heat sink. And then the airflow continues to be pushed towards the heat sink by subsequent airflow. The gas channel 5 is arranged circuitously depending on profiles of internal components and parts inside the lighting and/or signaling device 400 and spaces among them, to form a plurality of corners therein at relatively small angles inclined among walls of the gas channel and to point generally towards the surface of the outer lens, which function as the region of interest having high risk of producing the condensation. Therefore, such a configuration may avoid excessively large loss in momentum of air. Preferably, except for reduced cross sections provided at downstream sides adjacent to several corners, cross sections of the gas channel 5 at other locations have substantially same dimension and shape, so as to take advantage of the Bernoulli principle to accelerate airflow to ensure that flow rate of the airflow of air subsequently arriving at the surface of the outer lens is substantially consistent. In addition, for example, an enclosed housing may be provided around the fan, especially below the fan, such that the air flow exhausted out of the second channel outlet 51 is reflected by the enclosed housing towards the fan 4, and in turn blown towards the heat sink 41 located downstream and at the light source 4001, so as to play a principal role in heat dissipation for the lighting and/or signaling device 400 and then exhausted , from the heat sink as illustrated in 17. And based on above embodiment of the disclosure, it may be taken into consideration that, the ventilation may tend to bring in external moisture into the vehicle lamp, which may readily facilitate occurrence of condensation therein. Therefore, at an entrance of the fan which functions as the flow guiding component or the gas channel 5, for the airflow, a heater may be provided additionally so as to remove excessive moisture; or alternatively, an opening provided with a labyrinth seal may be provided there for ventilation; or otherwise, another opening provided with a filtering membrane or capillaries may be provided for ventilation. Specifically, in an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the embodiments as illustrated in 18a differ from that as illustrated in 18b in that, in 18a, the lower side below the fan which functions as the flow guiding component is opened, so as to extract gas from external environment into the inner chamber due to the pressure difference created by extraction of the fan, and in such a condition, the extraction/suction effect of the fan cooperates with a deflection effect of the airflow applied by the upper wall portion of the gas channel 5 which is arranged alongside the air inlet side of the fan, so as to implement a two-way flow splitting functionality which blows simultaneously the airflow towards the heat sink and towards the gas channel 5 respectively. In comparison, as illustrated in 18b, the lower side below the fan is an enclosed wall portion of the housing, such that the air in the back portion of the inner chamber defined by the back chamber shell 500 as illustrated in 20 may essentially be extracted via the gas channel 5, due to the pressure difference caused by the extraction effect of the fan And the airflow may travel over the surface of the outer lens, i. e. , contrary to the condition as illustrated in 18a, both intending to function to prevent occurrence of condensation thereon. In such a condition, the direction of the airflow in the gas channel is essential opposite to that as illustrated in 18a, thus there is no two-way flow splitting in the embodiment as illustrated in 18b. Therefore, the embodiment of 18b functions as an alternative to that of 18a. In above embodiments of the disclosure, the flow guiding component such as the fan 4 and the like may be adopted to drive the airflow initially, and also by the circuitous arrangement of the gas channel 5, and corners therein as well as the decreased cross sections at a downstream side immediately adjacent to the corners, a forced flow of the airflow may be further guided so as to accelerate the airflow over the surface of the outer lens where it passes, and to diminish or even eliminate the temperature differences among various subdivided regions thereof. As such, the condensation within the vehicle lamp may be controlled so as to be prevented or eliminated swiftly, without any dependency on any anti-fog coating, and in turn without any restriction of aging/degradation of the coating. Furthermore, since an air circulation device may be used for driving the airflow in motion forcibly, an overheating problem in the vehicle lamp , of the outer lens thereof may be avoided, so as to decrease requirements on heat resistance property of the components of the vehicle lamp. By way of example, the flow guiding component may for example be a fan 4 mounted on the lamp shell, or another device, such as a vacuum suction device, an air pump and the like. In practice, the flow guiding component may be in a form of a single fan, or alternatively a combination of two or more fans. The combination of a plurality of fan may implement a more complicated flow path of the airflow. In an example, the flow guiding component comprises two or more fans mounted on the lamp shell, which face towards different directions for example, the two or more fans facing towards the heat sink 41 and the gas channel 5 respectively as illustrated in 18a, or located at other positions within the lighting and/or signaling device such that the air may flow in a predetermined flow path which twist and/or turns, in this way, the flow path of the airflow may extend and turn along a plurality of directions, such that exchange among various components within the lamp shell may be implemented more sufficiently. In an embodiment, in addition to the flow guiding component and the gas channel 5, a temperature and/or humidity sensor and a controller may further be provided. The temperature and/or humidity sensor are/is configured to measure a temperature and/or a humidity inside the lamp shell; and the controller is configured to control the gas guiding device to change local flow rate and direction of the air flow depending on results of measurement of the temperature and/or humidity sensor. With the temperature and/or humidity sensor and the controller, both the flow rate and direction of the airflow may be adjusted timely or even in real time, so as to improve efficiency of heat dissipation and increase the flow rate of the airflow flowing above the surface of the lens, facilitating save in energy. In an embodiment, it may further provide an additional flow guiding device, such as an additional fan and the like, in the gas channel at either one or more corners of the gas channel, for forcing the air to flow, such that the flow path of the airflow may turn and change along the profile of the inner wall of the gas channel, fir a more smooth guidance of the airflow. For example, the flow guiding component and the additional flow guiding component may be driven by a conventional power source such as electrical power, solar energy, and the like. According to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the lighting and/or signaling device may be a vehicle lamp of a motor vehicle or a non-motor vehicle. In another aspect of the embodiments of the present disclosure, the lighting and/or signaling device is also provided, comprising the light source, the lamp shell and the gas guiding device as set forth above. At least one advantage may be provided by the technical solution of the embodiments of the disclosure, as below:One advantage lies in that, by a gas guiding device which may be easily manufactured depending on the internal profiles and arrangement of components and part thereof, heat dissipation in the lighting and/or signaling device, especially at the light source thereof, may be facilitated. Another advantage lies in that, meanwhile, the airflow may be accelerated, over the surface of the outer lens which is readily condensable, to avoid condensation.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "The invention relates to a connection device for connecting a first component to a second component of an orthopedic device.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Orthopedic devices may be ortheses or prostheses, for example. These devices consist of a multitude of different components, such as rail elements, that have to be connected to one another. To this end, a range of different connection devices are known from the prior art. In particular, it is often the case that orthoses should serve to apply forces to certain body parts of the wearer of the orthosis. For example, in the case of a knee orthosis that is used to relieve osteoarthritic complaints, a force moving in the medial direction can be applied to the knee of the wearer. For the knee to be able to bend when the orthosis is in use, two componentsnamely an upper leg rail and a lower leg railmust be connected to one another in the vicinity of the knee such that a bending of the knee is enabled; however, it must be possible for a force to act on the knee in the medial direction at the same time. To generate this force, a wide range of configurations of a corresponding connection device is known from the prior art. For example, inflatable cushions or cushions that can be filled with a fluid can be used that are arranged between the actual connection device and the knee. Alternatively, DE 600 35431 T2 describes joints for orthopedic knee orthoses which feature an upper leg shell and a lower leg shell, the angle of which can be adjusted relative to the rest of the rail system. This allows the force on the knee to be adjusted. However, it is disadvantageous that the possibility for adjustment is relatively small, despite a relatively large angular offset between the individual component, and that the available lever arm is relatively small.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "The invention thus aims to allow for an angle between two componentswhich are to be connected to one anotherto be adjusted as precisely as possible and across a broad force range, which overcomes or at least reduces the disadvantage of the prior art. The invention solves the problem by way of a connection device for connecting a first component to a second component of an orthopedic device, wherein the connection device comprises a first swivel element for arranging on the first component and a second swivel element for arranging on the second component, wherein a first adjustment element is arranged on the first swivel element, which has a contact surface, and wherein the second swivel element has a second contact surface, wherein the first swivel element is arranged on the second swivel element such that it can be swivelled about a swivel axis and wherein the first adjustment element is arranged and designed in such a way that the first contact surface lies flat on the second contact surface. The two swivel elements of a connection device according to the invention are therefore arranged next to one another such that they can be swivelled. A swivelling about this swivel axis allows the angle between the two components that are to be connected to be adjusted and changed. With a connection device according to the invention, the first contact surface, which is arranged on the first adjustment element on the first swivel element, lies flat on the second contact, which is arranged on the second swivel element. Here, the position of the first contact surface is crucial regarding the angle between the two swivel elements when they lie on top of one another. In a preferred configuration, the first adjustment element is arranged on the first swivel element such that it can be detached. This renders it easy to remove and replace, for example with another first adjustment element that comprises a contact surface with a slightly different form or that is positioned slightly differently, such that an angle between the first swivel element and the second swivel element can be adjusted and changed by exchanging the first adjustment elements. The swivel element can be clipped in, plugged in, screwed in or arranged on the first swivel element using another positive-locking method or another detachable method. It is especially preferable if the first swivel element is arranged such that it can be rotated about a rotational axis, wherein a radial distance of the first contact surface from the rotational axis varies. If the first adjustment element is now rotated about the rotational axis, the area of the first contact surface that comes into contact with the second contact surface changes. This area is displaced along the first contact surface. Given that, according to the invention, the radial distance of the first contact surface from the rotational axis varies, a rotation of the first adjustment element causes a swivelling of the first swivel element relative to the second swivel element about the swivel axis, which leads to a change in the angle between the two components that are to be connected. Consequently, a rotation of the first adjustment element allows the angle between the two components that are to be connected to be adjusted in a simple, reproducible and secure manner. Preferably, the first adjustment element features a tool interface, such as a hexagon socket or a square socket, which is designed to engage with a corresponding tool. If a tool is required to rotate the first adjustment element, an inadvertent movement and thus an inadvertent shifting is prevented. An inadvertent shifting could cause an angle between the components that are to be connected, and therefore perhaps a force that can be applied to a body part, to shift and possibly move out of the range that is therapeutically reasonable. Here, this is prevented from happening. Preferably, the radial distance of the first contact surface from the rotational axis in the circumferential direction varies across at least one part of the circumference. It preferably varies across the entire circumference. As a result, it can be ensured that a rotation of the first adjustment element about the rotational axis always results in a change in the distance between the second contact surface, which lies on the first contact surface, and the rotational axis, such that a swivelling of the two swivel elements about the swivel axis occurs. This applies so long as the radial distance of the first contact surface from the rotational axis in the area of the first contact surface that lies on the second contact surface changes upon a rotation of the first adjustment element. Preferably, the first contact surface is inclined relative to the rotational axis in at least one area. It is preferable if said contact surface is entirely inclined relative to the rotational axis. This includes the case in which the incline changes sign, i. e. direction, such that the first contact surface extends parallel to the rotational axis at one or a few points. This renders it possible to actually bring a relatively large area of the first contact surface into contact with the second contact surface. By carefully selecting the incline, it is possible to ensure that the size of this contact area of the two contact surfaces does not change. The greater this contact area of the two contact surfaces, in which the two contact surfaces are in contact with one another, the greater the force that can be transferred upon a rotation of the adjustment element, such that a displacement of the swivel position of the two swivel elements relative to one another is rendered especially simple and secure to achieve. In a preferred embodiment of the connection device, the first component and/or the second component can be swivelled relative to the connection device when it is arranged on the respective swivel element. This renders it possible for the connection element to simultaneously assume the function of a joint. This is especially advantageous in the case of knee orthoses; however, it is also beneficial in other orthopedic devices. The force that is to be applied to the body part depends on, amongst other factors, the lever arm, i. e. in particular on the length of the two components to be connected to one another up to the next point of contact with the body of the wearer of the orthosis or prosthesis. Should a connection device according to an example of an embodiment of the present invention, which is able to simultaneously assume the function of a joint, now be used, it mayin the case of a knee orthosis, for examplebe arranged directly next to or at least close to the knee, especially the knee axis. In this case, the two components that are to be connected to one another may be rail elements, for example, which lead to an upper leg and a lower leg belt or a corresponding shell. Thus the total length of the two components becomes a lever via which the force can be transferred, for example in the case of a three-point action. Even in the case of a relatively small angular change, this results in a relatively large change in the applied force, such that the force to be applied can be adjusted across a relatively large area. A configuration in which both components can be swivelled relative to the connection device is especially preferable. In a preferred configuration, the first adjustment element can be connected to the first component such that it is torque-proof. In this special configuration, the first swivel element is consequently swivelled relative to the second swivel element when the first component is swivelled relative to the connection device and in particular relative to the second component. With a knee orthosis, this occurs during walking, for example, when the knee is bent. In this example, this causes the force acting on the knee to vary over the course of a gait cycle, meaning that this force path can be individually adjusted by carefully selecting the shape and arrangement of the first contact surface. The applied force may increase, decrease or remain constant in some areas over the course of the step. This may be adjusted by adjusting a progression of the radial distance of the first contact surface from the rotational axis. If the radial distance remains constant across a circumferential area about the rotational axis, a rotation of the adjustment element leads neither to a swivelling of the two swivel elements relative to another and thus nor to a change in the force to be applied. However, if the radial distance of the first contact surface from the rotational axis of the adjustment element changes in the swivel region that is covered by the movement of the body part, this change in distance leads to a swivelling of the two swivel elements relative to one another and therefore also to a change in the force applied. A second adjustment element is preferably arranged on the second swivel element, said adjustment element comprising the second contact surface and preferably being arranged such that it can be detached and/or rotated about a second rotational axis. In this example of an embodiment, each of the two contact surfaces is consequently arranged on a rotatable adjustment element, which causes an adjustment range of the swivel position of the two swivel elements and therefore of the force to be applied on a body part to be further increased. The first adjustment element and/or the second adjustment element are preferred designed as multi-piece elements. In this way, it is conceivable to use a base part that is designed to be equipped with positive-locking elements on its circumferential side, for example protruding prongs or pins. These may be connected to a ring element that features corresponding positive-locking elements. The ring element can be easily exchanged or removed, for instance. An existing connection element can thus be easily adjusted to meet individual requirements and therapeutic needs, for example, without having to use a completely new connection element or conduct a complex removal and modification of an adjustment element. The ring element is simply removed and replaced by another suitable ring element or adjusted to meet the necessary requirements. The invention also solves the problem by way of a joint device for an orthopedic device, wherein the joint device comprises a first component, a second component and a connection device of the type described here, wherein the first component is arranged on the first swivel element and the second component on the second swivel element in such a way that the first component can be swivelled relative to the second swivel element about a joint axis, wherein the joint axis preferably forms a right angle with the swivel axis. Such joint devices are especially advantageous in the case of knee orthoses; however, they are also beneficial in other orthopedic devices. Here, the first component and the second component are preferably connected to one another in such a way that a swivelling of one of the two components relative to the connection device effects a swivelling of the respective other of the two components relative to the connection device. Preferably, this is achieved in that each of the two components features a multitude of teeth that engage and mesh with one another. Alternatively or additionally, the two components may be connected to one another by at least one, preferably at least two, traction transmission elements. A maximum swivel angle of the first component relative to the second swivel component is preferably restricted in at least one swivel direction by an adjustable end stop, which is preferably adjustable. It is particularly beneficial if a maximum swivel angle is restricted in both swivel directions by a respective end stop, said end stops preferably being adjustable. This enables the joint to be individually adapted and adjusted to meet to the respective needs.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "1 shows a joint device 1 according to a first example of an embodiment of the present invention in two different positions. It has a first component 2 and a second component 4. Both are arranged on a connection device 6, which features a first swivel element 8 with a first adjustment element 10 and a second swivel element 12. The first swivel element 8 and the second swivel element 12 can be swivelled relative to one another about a swivel axis. In the two depictions in 1, it is clear that the first component 2 and the second component 4 can be swivelled relative to one another about a joint axis, which is not depicted. In the present example of an embodiment, this does not effect a swivelling of the first swivel element 8 relative to the second swivel element 12 about the swivel axis 14. 2 depicts an exploded view through a joint device 1. It shows the first component 2 and the second component 4, each of which has several teeth 16 that engage with each other when the two components 2, 4 are arranged on the connection device 6. The first swivel element 8 features a central bore 18, whichwhen mountedmoves so that it overlaps with a hole 20 that is arranged in the first component 2. To this end, the first component 2 is inserted into a slit 22, which is provided in the first swivel element 8. In the present example of an embodiment, the first adjustment element 10 consists of two plate-shaped elements, which can be connected to one another by way of the central bore 18 and through the hole 20. The upper element features a recess 24, which can engage with a tool in order to rotate the first adjustment element 10 about a rotational axis that extends through the central bore 18. The first adjustment element 10 features the first contact surface 26, the radial distance of which from a rotational axis of the first adjustment element 10 varies across the circumference of the first adjustment element 10. Two pins 28, which are inserted through corresponding recesses, connect the two swivel element 8, 12 such that they can be swivelled. The swivel axis runs through their centre. The second swivel element 12 also has a slit 30, into which the second component 4 is inserted to move a central bore 32 so that it overlaps with a hole 34, which is arranged in the second component 4. Connecting pieces 36 are then inserted and the second component 4 thereby arranged on the second swivel element 12. The second swivel element features a second contact surface 38. Unlike in the example of an embodiment shown in 1, the joint device 1 according to 2 comprises a connection pin 40 that can be connected, via two holes 42, to the first component 2 and the first adjustment element 10 in a torque-proof manner. It can slide in an elongated hole 44 in the first swivel element 8. If the first component 2 is now moved relative to the first swivel element 8, the first adjustment element 10 moves at the same time, so that a displacement of the first contact surface 26 relative to the second contact surface 38, and therefore a swivelling of the two pins 28 about the swivel axis, occurs. This is shown in 3. Three sectional views through the joint device 1 can be seen, wherein each view has a different swivel angle between the first component 2 and the second component 4 about the swivel axis. This is due to the different radial distances and inclines of the first contact surface 26 relative to the second contact surface 38. If the first adjustment element 10 is rotated about the rotational axis, the incline and radial distance of the first contact surface 26 changes in the region that engages with the second contact surface 38; this results in the depicted swivelling. 4 shows a partial sectional view. The two pins 28 can be recognized, said pins forming both the swivel axis and the teeth 16 of the two components 2, 4, which are engaged with one another. 5 depicts a further exploded view through a joint device 1 according to a further example of an embodiment of the present invention. One difference between this and the view depicted in 1 is that the embodiment shown in 5 does not have a connecting pin 40. The first adjustment element 10 is also constructed differently. The two parts that form the first adjustment element 10 each comprise a central part 46; a ring element 48 is arranged on each said central part. This ring element can be easily exchanged and fixed to the respective central part 46 via positive-locking elements 50. In the configuration shown in 5, the design of the hole 34 and the correspondingly designed connecting end 52 of the first adjustment element 10 enables a positive-locking connection between the first adjustment element 10 and the first component 2, such that a swivelling of the first component 2 relative to the connection device 6 also effects a change in the angle of inclination and a swivelling of the first swivel element 8 relative to the second swivel element 12 about the swivel axis that extends through the two pins 28. 6 shows two depictions of another embodiment of a joint device, the connection device 6 of which features the first adjustment element 10 and a second adjustment element 54. An outer lateral surface of the second adjustment element 54 forms the second contact surface 38. 7 depicts two orthoses 56, which are designed as knee orthoses and which each feature a joint device 1. It is arranged between the two components 2, 4. The swivel axis extends in the drawing plane. Looking at the position of the two adjustment elements 10, 54, two settings can be seen, so that an angle between the two components 2, 4 is designed to be different. 8 depicts a further orthosis 56 with a joint device 1. It also comprises a tension element 58, the end stops 60 of which can be moved using the tool 62 depicted. A swivelling of the two components 2, 4 relative to one another results in a movement of the tension element 58, which is arranged at both ends on the second component 4 and is securely connected to the first swivel element 8 in the example of an embodiment shown. As a result, the endswhich are not depictedof the tension element 58 are displaced until they strike one of the end stops 60, where applicable. 9 depicts two partial sectional views of a joint device 1.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "The dimensions of trench power MOSFETs metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor may be reduced for improving the electrical performance and decreasing the costs from generation to generation, which may be enabled both through better lithography systems and more powerful tools with an improved process control. The reduction of geometrical dimensions might not come without side effects. By reducing the geometries, the width and thus the extent of the electrode in lateral direction may be continuously reduced. For example, polycrystalline silicon also called polysilicon is used as an electrode material, which shows a strongly increasing sheet resistance below a certain layer thickness due to the crystalline structure of the material. In a stripe cell, this may apply in particular to the field plate electrode, but also the gate resistance might not be at values of &lt;1 Ohm, which may be desired for some applications. Some concepts may use individual cells instead of stripes, where the field plate electrode may have a columnar shape so-called needle-shape and is surrounded by a circumferential gate. While the field plate resistance may be rather uncritical due to its direct connection to the source metal, the gate resistance may provide difficulties as the gate trench is arranged between the columns of the field plate electrode. For devices in voltage classes up to approx. 120V very narrow gate widths may be implemented. In this example, the effective width of the gate electrode may be less than 100 nm, which may lead to high values of the distributed gate resistance. For improving the electrical performance and decreasing the costs, analogously to the silicon counterparts, silicon carbide SiC trench power MOSFETs may be further reduced in their geometrical dimensions. This may be enabled by improved lithography systems and more powerful tools with an improved process control and/or alternative cell structures may be used, which may enable minimizing the structural sizes due to their cell design. By reducing the geometries of the cell, the width and thus the extent of the electrode in lateral direction of the gate electrode may be continuously reduced as well. As mentioned, polysilicon may have a strongly increasing sheet resistance below a certain layer thickness due to the crystalline structure of the material. The resulting gate resistance may cause increasing difficulties. Some cell concepts may have an average gate width of approximately 1 m and may require the introduction of gate fingers at least in case of large chip areas. Apart from the increase of the gate resistance due to the smaller cross sections, an additional increase due to material characteristics may be considered. Consequently, it may be desired to reduce the resistance of gate electrodes and/or field electrodes.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "Various examples will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some examples are illustrated. In the figures, the thicknesses of lines, layers and/or regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Accordingly, while further examples are capable of various modifications and alternative forms, some particular examples thereof are shown in the figures and will subsequently be described in detail. However, this detailed description does not limit further examples to the particular forms described. Further examples may cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the disclosure. Same or like numbers refer to like or similar elements throughout the description of the figures, which may be implemented identically or in modified form when compared to one another while providing for the same or a similar functionality. It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being connected or coupled to another element, the elements may be directly connected or coupled or via one or more intervening elements. If two elements A and B are combined using an or, this is to be understood to disclose all possible combinations, i. e. only A, only B as well as A and B, if not explicitly or implicitly defined otherwise. An alternative wording for the same combinations is at least one of A and B or A and/or B. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, for combinations of more than two Elements. The terminology used herein for the purpose of describing particular examples is not intended to be limiting for further examples. Whenever a singular form such as a, an and the is used and using only a single element is neither explicitly nor implicitly defined as being mandatory, further examples may also use plural elements to implement the same functionality. Likewise, when a functionality is subsequently described as being implemented using multiple elements, further examples may implement the same functionality using a single element or processing entity. It will be further understood that the terms comprises, comprising, includes and/or including, when used, specify the presence of the stated features, integers, steps, operations, processes, acts, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, processes, acts, elements, components and/or any group thereof. Unless otherwise defined, all terms including technical and scientific terms are used herein in their ordinary meaning of the art to which the examples belong. Some concepts may implement finger structures, which provide a low ohmic connection from the respective trench electrodes to the respective potential. In this way, very low resistances may be realized, which may be outweighed by a corresponding increasing loss of active area. This negative influence may be higher, the lower the on-resistance per area RonA of a technology is and might be undesired for wide bandgap technologies like SiC-MOSFETs. Another concept may make use of siliciding the electrode surface. In this way, a reduction of the gate resistance may be achieved. However, siliciding the electrode surface may be difficult for SiC-MOSFET gate widths in a range of some 100 nm. A polysilicon gate may also be replaced by a metal gate, which may cause a strong reduction of the distributed resistance. A metal as a gate electrode is used in the field of logics, but the requirements in the field of logics and power may be significantly different. According to a concept, tungsten may be used for implementing gate electrodes in the power area, which may require the additional use of a titanium nitride TiN barrier to the gate insulation layer gate oxide. As the deposition of the TiN barrier may be executed using aggressive chemistry chlorine, the used oxide may need to be of very good quality. Otherwise, damages to the oxide may occur, which may reduce the lifetime and negatively influence the breakthrough field strength, which in case of SiC-MOSFETs may require a stronger shielding of a gate insulation layer and thus a decreased overall performance. For example, if an oxide is used as a gate insulation layer, the use of grown oxides in a dry atmosphere at high temperatures or alternatively the use of deposited oxides, which are densified at very high temperatures and/or post oxidized, may be necessary. For example, densifying may be done at 1150 C. and post oxidation at 1100 C. to improve the quality of the gate insulation layer. This may cause problems, when used in SiC-MOSFET. Densifying the deposited tetraethylorthosilicate oxide, for the saturation of interface states, may take place at high temperatures in a range between 1100 C. -1250 C. in a nitrogen monoxide NO atmosphere. The anneal may cause a densification of the deposited tetraethylorthosilicate beside the saturation of interface states by NO. The densification may improve the intrinsic properties of the oxide and may enable less defects in the oxide. The densification may be used for silicon devices as well. The exact process parameters may be selected for good interface characteristics and may be insufficient as a barrier for a tungsten gate for subsequent process steps in an aggressive atmosphere like in a TiN deposition. Subsequent densifying at the indicated high temperatures may already lead to an interface depassivation, and thus may result in a deterioration of the component characteristics. Densifying in oxygen at temperatures above 800 C. may lead to an interface depassivation. A 100% inertial anneal in N2 after interface passivation may lead to a shift regarding the threshold voltage, but might not substantially influence the interface characteristics at least with short annealing times and temperatures 1000 C. The high temperature budget may cause difficulties for highly phosphorous-doped substrates low-voltage MOSFET for operating voltages &lt;=40V as well as this may lead to a pronounced diffusion tail for silicon devices. This may again result in a deteriorated RonA and consequently all in all to a deteriorated figure of merit FOMs. It may be desired to provide a concept for a low resistance of gate electrodes for SiC devices and/or field electrodes for semiconductor devices. 1 shows a schematic cross section of a part of a silicon carbide device according to an embodiment. The silicon carbide device 100 may comprise a silicon carbide SiC substrate comprising a body region 110 and a source region 120 of a transistor cell. Further, the silicon carbide device 100 may comprise a titanium carbide TiC gate electrode 130 of the transistor cell. By using titanium carbide as material for the gate electrode, the electrical resistance of the gate electrode may be significantly reduced in comparison to a polysilicon gate electrode. In this way, the implementation of gate fingers to contact the gates more often might not be necessary, which may reduce the required die area. Further, the homogeneity of the switching of transistor cells may be improved and/or switching losses may be reduced, for example, for devices with high switching frequencies. Furthermore, the use of titanium carbide can be advantageous for processing the wafers due to its high melting temperature. The source region 120 may be a doping region having a first conductivity type and the body region 110 may be a doping region having a second conductivity type. The body region 110 may be located adjacent to the source region 120 so that a pn-junction arises between the body region 110 and the source region 120. A doping region of the first conductivity type may be a p-doped region caused by incorporating aluminum ions or boron ions or an n-doped region caused by incorporating nitrogen ions or phosphor ions. Consequently, the second conductivity type indicates an opposite n-doping or p-doping. In other words, the first conductivity type may indicate an n-doping and the second conductivity type may indicate a p-doping or vice-versa. For example, the TiC gate electrode 130 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC gate electrode 130 comprises TiC as main material. The TiC gate electrode 130 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC gate electrode 130 may comprise at least 90% or at least 95% or at least 99% TiC. For example, the TiC gate electrode 130 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC gate electrode 130 may comprise solely TiC except for impurities and/or contaminations having no or only neglectable influence on the electrical functionality. For example, the TiC gate electrode 130 may comprise at least a TiC layer having a thickness of at least 50 nm or at least 100 nm or at least 200 nm. The TiC gate electrode 130 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC gate electrode 130 may be located adjacent to and/or directly adjoining a gate insulation layer of the transistor cell. The gate insulation layer of the transistor cell may be an oxide layer SiO2 layer located between the body region 120 and the TiC gate electrode 130. In some embodiments, the gate insulation layer may comprise a so-called high-K dielectric. The TiC gate electrode 130 may be connected to a gate contact structure, a gate metallization structure, a gate wiring structure and/or a gate pad. A gate voltage may be applied to the TiC gate electrode 130 during operation of the silicon carbide device 100 to control a current flow through a channel region of the body region 120. The TiC gate electrode 130 may be a planar gate electrode. A planar electrode may, for example, be positioned on a front side surface of the silicon carbide substrate. Alternatively, the TiC gate electrode 130 may be located in a gate trench. The TiC gate electrode 130 may then be part of a so-called trench gate. For example, the transistor cell comprises a trench gate comprising the gate trench and the TiC gate electrode 130 located in the gate trench. The gate trench may extend from a surface the front side surface of the silicon carbide substrate into the silicon carbide substrate. A width of the gate trench measured at the surface of the silicon carbide substrate may be at most 1. 5 m or at most 1. 2 m or at most 0. 8 m or at most 0. 5 m. The width of the gate trench may be constant or may vary along the gate trench. If the width varies along the gate trench, a width of the gate trench may be at most 1. 5 m or at most 1. 2 m or at most 0. 8 m or at most 0. 5 m at the narrowest part of the gate trench. The gate trench may extend deeper into the silicon carbide substrate than the body region 120. The gate trench may be completely filled with TiC material except for a gate insulation layer of the trench gate. The gate insulation layer may line the gate trench. Alternatively, one or more voids may exist in the center or in proximity to the center of the gate trench. Alternatively, a TiC layer of the TiC gate electrode 130 may be located adjacent to the gate insulation layer and a core region of the gate trench may be filled with another material polysilicon. For example, the silicon carbide device 100 may comprise a plurality of gate trenches or a grid of gate trenches. The gate trenches of the plurality of gate trenches may be stripe-shaped gate trenches. A titanium carbide gate electrode may be located in each gate trench of the plurality of gate trenches. The silicon carbide device 100 may comprise further trenches edge trenches in addition to the plurality of gate trenches. The titanium carbide gate electrodes may be connected to a gate contact structure 131 a gate runner or gate ring at an edge of a cell field of the silicon carbide device 100 and/or an edge of an active area of the silicon carbide substrate. For example, the titanium carbide gate electrodes may be connected to a gate metallization structure 131 solely at end regions 132 of the titanium carbide gate electrodes as shown in 10A and 10B. The end regions 132 of the titanium carbide gate electrodes may extend from the respective lateral ends of the titanium carbide gate electrodes over at most 10% of a length of the respective titanium carbide gate electrode as shown in 10A and 10B. Due to the low electrical resistance of the TiC gate electrodes, it may be sufficient to contact the TiC gate electrodes at the ends only. The implementation of gate finger may be avoided. Additionally, the silicon carbide device 100 may comprise a titanium carbide contact electrode located in the gate trench as shown in 4 or in a contact trench as shown in 3. The TiC contact electrode may be electrically connected to the source region 120 of the transistor cell. If the TiC contact electrode is located in the gate trench, the TiC contact electrode may be located deeper within the gate trench than the TiC gate electrode 130 at least in places. For example, the TiC contact electrode may be located below the TiC gate electrode 130 at least in places. A reference voltage source voltage may be applied to the TiC contact electrode during operation of the silicon carbide device 100. The TiC contact electrode may influence the electric field in proximity of the bottom of the gate trench and/or may contact a buried doping region as for the deep p-junction field effect transistor as shown in 4 at the bottom of the gate trench. The contact trench may be different to the gate trench and/or may be separate from the gate trench. The contact trench may be free of a gate electrode and/or of a material directly electrically connected to the gate electrode. For example, the contact trench may be a source contact trench as shown in 3. For example, a transistor transistor cell may be arranged at only one side of the trench gate as shown in 2. In this case, a first sidewall of the gate trench may adjoin the transistor cell. A second, opposite sidewall may be free of a transistor cell. Alternatively, the transistor cell of the silicon carbide device 100 may be located on two sides of the gate trench so that a body region may be located at two opposite sides of the gate trench as shown in 1, 3 or 4. For example, at least one portion of each body region may be in contact with a respective sidewall of a gate trench, a gate insulation layer of the gate trench. For example, the transistor cell is a vertical transistor cell configured to conduct current between a front side of the silicon carbide substrate and a backside of the silicon carbide substrate. The source region 120, the body region 110, and a drift region of the transistor cell may be arranged vertically within the silicon carbide substrate. The source region 120 may be located at a front side surface of the silicon carbide substrate. For example, a vertical direction and a vertical dimension or thicknesses of layers may be measured orthogonal to a front side surface and/or a back side surface of the silicon carbide substrate and a lateral direction and lateral dimensions may be measured in parallel to the front side surface and/or a back side surface of the silicon carbide substrate. The front side of the SiC substrate may be the side used to implement more sophisticated and complex structures gates of transistors, wiring structures and/or contact pads than at the back side of the SiC substrate, since the process parameters temperature and the handling may be limited for the back side, if structures are already formed at the front side of the SiC substrate, for example. The silicon carbide device 100 may further comprise a drain region of the transistor cell for a MOSFET having the first conductivity type or a collector region of the transistor cell for an insulated gate bipolar transistor IGBT having the second conductivity type. The drain region or the collector region may have an average net doping concentration. The average net doping concentration of the drain region or the collector region may be at least 30 times or even at least 100 times the average net doping concentration of the drift region, for example. The drain region or the collector region may be located at a back side of the silicon carbide substrate. The transistor cell of the silicon carbide device 100 may be a transistor cell of a plurality of transistor cells of a transistor arrangement. Each transistor cell may comprise one or more source regions distributed or located along a gate, at least one body region and a gate electrode a trench gate electrode located within a gate trench extending into the SiC substrate, for example, Further, the transistor cells of the plurality of transistor cells may share a common mutual drift region and/or a common drain region if the transistor cells are MOSFET cells or a common collector region if the transistor cells are IGBT cells. For example, the transistor arrangement of the silicon carbide device 100 comprises a plurality of source doping regions connected to a source wiring structure, a plurality of TiC gate electrodes or a TiC gate electrode grid connected to a gate wiring structure and a back side drain or collector metallization. The silicon carbide device 100 may be a power semiconductor device. A power semiconductor device or an electrical structure the transistor cell of the silicon carbide device 100 of the power semiconductor device may have a breakdown voltage or blocking voltage of more than 300 V or more than 1000 V or more than 2 kV. The proposed concept may use TiC as a gate material for SiC power transistors. TiC may be a very temperature-stable material having low sheet resistance. The use of titanium carbide as a temperature-stable and highly conductive electrode material for the gate in SiC MOSFETs may be proposed for realizing a low distributed resistance instead of implementing polysilicon and/or the active area consuming gate finger structures. Additionally, TiC may be used as material for a contact electrode or a source electrode for contacting buried regions, as, , shown in 4. For example, the titanium carbide is formed by a thermal process at temperatures of at most 1000 C. after the deposition of carbon and titanium after a preceding patterning explained in more detail in connection with 8. Due to a consequent reduction of the required temperature budget, a depassivation of the oxide interface states of the gate insulation layer may be avoided as far as possible, for example. The proposed concept may enable lower manufacturing costs at an improved performance preventing inactive areas without controlled current flow for finger structures with at the same time lower distributed resistances and/or a pitch reduction by smaller gate trench geometries. Some embodiments relate to semiconductor devices with a transistor comprising a TiC gate electrode as described with respect to 1. In these examples, the used semiconductor substrate may be another wide band gap semiconductor substrate or a silicon substrate instead of silicon carbide. For example, a wide band gap semiconductor substrate may have a band gap larger than 2 eV or larger than 3 eV. For example, the wide band gap semiconductor substrate may be a silicon carbide substrate, a diamond C substrate, a gallium oxide Ga2O3, gallium arsenide GaAs or a gallium nitride GaN substrate. The semiconductor substrate may be a semiconductor bulk substrate obtained from a semiconductor boule or an epitaxially grown semiconductor substrate or may comprise an epitaxial semiconductor layer for implementing the source region, the body region and/or the drift region of a vertical transistor cell grown on a semiconductor bulk substrate for implementing a drain region or a collector region of a transistor cell. 2 shows a schematic cross section of a part of a silicon carbide device having a channel at one side of each gate trench according to an embodiment. The silicon carbide device 200 may be implemented similar to the silicon carbide device described in connection with 1. The silicon carbide device 200 comprises a transistor cell comprising a body region 110 located vertically between a highly n-doped source region 120 and a lightly n-doped drift region 230. Further, an n-doped current spread region 220 may be optionally located between the body region 110 and the drift region 230. The silicon carbide device 200 comprises a TiC gate electrode 130 in a gate trench. For example, a gate insulation layer of the trench gate is located between the body region and the TiC gate electrode 130. In an operating mode of the transistor, a current flow through a channel region of the transistor may be controlled by a gate voltage applied to the TiC gate electrode 130. A highly p-doped region 240 of the silicon carbide device 200 may be located adjacent to the gate insulation layer at a second side wall of the gate structure opposite to a first side wall of the gate trench located adjacent to the body region of the transistor. The highly p-doped region 240 extends from the bottom of the gate trench along the second side wall of the trench gate to a highly n-doped region 260 and/or to the front side surface. Further, a highly p-doped shielding region 250 may be located at the bottom of the trench gate. The highly p-doped shielding region 250 may be in contact with or part of the highly p-doped region 240. The highly n-doped region 260 may extend along the second side wall of the trench gate from the highly p-doped region 240 to the front side surface of the silicon carbide substrate. The highly n-doped region 260 may be formed simultaneously with the source region 120. For example, the highly n-doped region 260 may be electrically connected to the source region 120. Further, a source metallization 210 is located on the silicon carbide substrate. The source metallization 210 is electrically connected to the source region 120. Further, the source metallization 210 may be connected to the body region 110, via the highly p-doped region 240. 2 shows an asymmetric MOSFET cell concept. Although the average gate width width of the gate electrode averaged along the gate trench may be less than 1. 5 m or less than 1. 2 m or less than 0. 8 m, the introduction of gate fingers for large chip areas might not be necessary due to the implementation of a TiC gate electrode. More details and aspects are mentioned in connection with the embodiments described above or below. The silicon carbide device shown in 2 may comprise one or more optional additional features corresponding to one or more aspects mentioned in connection with the proposed concept of one or more embodiments described above or below 1 and/or 3-9. 3 shows a schematic cross section of a part of a silicon carbide device 300 comprising a buried p-doped region 350 connected to the source metallization according to an embodiment. Some aspects of the silicon carbide device 300 may be implemented similar or identical to the silicon carbide device described in connection with 1 and/or 2. However, a source contact trench is located between two gate trenches. The source contact trench may extend deeper into the silicon carbide substrate than the body region 110 or they may extend to an equal depth. A buried p-doped region 350 is located at the bottom of the source contact trench. For example, the buried p-doped region 350 may be contacted by the source contact trench. Further, a highly p-doped body contact region 340 is located adjacent to the source contact trench and vertically between the source region 120 and the buried p-doped region 350. A source contact electrode 370 is located in the source contact trench to obtain an ohmic contact to the source region 120 and the body region 110. The source contact electrode 370 may be a TiC source contact electrode connected to the source metallization 210 power metallization. The drift region 310 is implemented by a lightly n-doped epitaxial layer. Additionally, an n-doped buffer layer 320 is implemented between the drain region 330 highly n-doped substrate layer and the drift region 310. Further, an inter-layer dielectric may be located vertically between the source metallization 210 and the silicon carbide substrate. For example, the cell concept shown in 3 may use structure widths width of the gate electrode as small as possible, for example, in a range 350 nm or less than 500 nm or less than 250 nm for achieving a good performance. Due to the usage of TiC for the gate electrode, an increase of the gate resistance due to the smaller cross section and/or an additional increase due to material characteristics may be avoided. More details and aspects are mentioned in connection with the embodiments described above or below. The silicon carbide device shown in 3 may comprise one or more optional additional features corresponding to one or more aspects mentioned in connection with the proposed concept of one or more embodiments described above or below 1-2 and/or 4-9. 4 shows a schematic cross section of a part of a silicon carbide device 400 comprising contact electrodes within the gate trenches according to an embodiment. The silicon carbide device 400 may be implemented similar to the silicon carbide device described in connection with 1, 2 and/or 3. In addition to the TiC gate electrode 130, an additional TiC electrode 430 may be located at a bottom of the gate trench. The additional TiC electrode 430 may be used to contact a buried shielding region 440 deep p-junction field effect transistor JFET region located adjacent to and/or below a bottom of the gate trench. The additional TiC electrode 430 may be connected or connectable to a different voltage source voltage than the gate electrode the gate voltage. 4 may show a cell concept with a buried electrode additional TiC electrode 430 for contacting the buried shielding region 440. Using polysilicon may result in the necessity of finger structures, in particular for connecting the buried regions 440, which may lead to a substantial loss of active area. This may be avoided by the implementation of the additional electrode 430. More details and aspects are mentioned in connection with the embodiments described above or below. The silicon carbide device shown in 4 may comprise one or more optional additional features corresponding to one or more aspects mentioned in connection with the proposed concept of one or more embodiments described above or below 1-3 and/or 5-9. 5 shows a schematic cross section of a part of a semiconductor device according to an embodiment. The semiconductor device 500 may comprise a semiconductor substrate comprising a body region 110 and a source region 120 of a transistor cell. Further, the semiconductor device 500 may comprise a titanium carbide field electrode 530 of the transistor cell. The titanium carbide field electrode 530 may be connected or connectable to a reference voltage metallization structure so that a reference voltage source voltage independent from a gate voltage of the transistor cell is providable to the titanium carbide field electrode 530. By using titanium carbide as material for the field electrode, the resistance of the field electrode may be significantly reduced in comparison to a polysilicon field electrode. In this way, the implementation of contact finger structures to contact the field electrodes at several contact points might not be necessary, which may reduce the required die area. By implementing a field electrode field plate or a columnar field electrode, a lower on-resistance may be achieved, while providing the same breakdown voltage. For example, a field plate trench structure may utilize lateral charge compensation, altering the electrical field profile for higher breakdown, which may enable an increased doping concentration in the drift region. In this way, the on-resistance may be significantly reduced. The titanium carbide field electrode 530 may be connected or connectible through a control transistor to a reference voltage metallization structure a reference voltage wiring structure and/or a reference voltage pad, for example, the source metallization structure, the source wiring structure and/or the source pad. During operation, the reference voltage source voltage and/or ground voltage may be provided to the titanium carbide field electrode 530 through the reference voltage metallization structure. The titanium carbide field electrode 530 may be located in a trench a field electrode trench and/or a gate trench. The trench may extend from a surface of the semiconductor substrate into the semiconductor substrate. For example, the TiC field electrode 530 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC field electrode 530 comprises TiC as a main material. The TiC field electrode 530 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC field electrode 530 may comprise at least 90% or at least 95% or at least 99% TiC. For example, the TiC field electrode 530 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC field electrode 530 may comprise solely TiC except for impurities and/or contaminations having no or only neglectable influence on the electrical functionality. For example, the TiC field electrode 530 may comprise at least a TiC layer having a thickness of at least 50 nm or at least 100 nm or at least 200 nm. The TiC field electrode 530 or at least a TiC layer of the TiC field electrode 530 may be located directly adjacent to a field electrode insulation layer of the transistor cell. The field electrode insulation layer of the transistor cell may be an oxide layer SiO2 layer located between the semiconductor substrate and the TiC field electrode 530. A thickness of the field electrode insulation layer may be larger than a thickness of a gate insulation layer of the transistor cell. The semiconductor device 500 may comprise a gate electrode a TiC gate electrode in addition to the TiC field electrode 530. The gate electrode may be located in the same trench as the field electrode 530 shown in 6 or in a separate gate trench shown in 7. If the gate electrode and the TiC field electrode 530 are located in the same trench, the TiC field electrode 530 may be located deeper in the trench than the gate electrode at least in places. The use of titanium carbide as a temperature-stable and highly conductive electrode material for the field plate and/or if applicable the gate of a field plate trench MOSFETs may be proposed for realizing a low distributed resistance instead of the often used polysilicon and in order to eliminate active area consuming finger structures. For example, the titanium carbide may be formed after the deposition of carbon and titanium after a preceding patterning by a thermal process explained in more detail in connection with 9. Lower manufacturing costs at an improved performance may be enabled preventing dead areas for finger structures with at the same time lower distributed resistances. The semiconductor substrate may be a silicon substrate. The semiconductor device 500 may be a power semiconductor device. A power semiconductor device or an electrical structure the transistor cell of the semiconductor device 500 of the power semiconductor device may have a breakdown voltage or blocking voltage of more than 10 V or more than 100 V or more than 300 V. More details and aspects are mentioned in connection with the embodiments described above or below. The semiconductor device shown in 5 may comprise one or more optional additional features corresponding to one or more aspects mentioned in connection with the proposed concept of one or more embodiments described above or below 1-4 and/or 6-9. 6 shows a schematic cross section of a part of a semiconductor device 600 comprising a field electrode within the gate trench according to an embodiment. The semiconductor device 600 may be implemented similar to the semiconductor device described in connection with 5. The semiconductor device 600 comprises a plurality of stripe-shaped gate trenches of transistor cells. A TiC field electrode 530 and a gate electrode 620 TiC gate electrode may be located in each gate trench. A source metallization structure 310 may be connected to the body region 110 and the source region 120. For example, the body region 110 is located vertically between the source region 120 and a drift region 630 of the transistor cell. A length of a stripe-shaped gate trench may be at least 10 times or at least 100 times a width of the stripe-shaped gate trench. More details and aspects are mentioned in connection with the embodiments described above or below. The semiconductor device shown in 6 may comprise one or more optional additional features corresponding to one or more aspects mentioned in connection with the proposed concept of one or more embodiments described above or below 1-5 and/or 7-9. 7 shows a schematic cross section of a part of semiconductor device 700 comprising a field electrode within a field electrode trench according to an embodiment. The semiconductor device 700 may be implemented similar to the semiconductor device described in connection with 5. The semiconductor device 700 may comprise a plurality of columnar field electrode trenches also called needle trenches surrounded by gate trenches of transistor cells. For example, the TiC field electrode 530 and the gate electrode 630 TiC gate electrode are located in separate trenches. A maximum depth of a columnar field electrode trench may be at least 5 times or at least 10 times a maximum lateral dimension of the columnar field electrode trench. A maximum depth of the columnar field electrode trench may be at least 2 times or at least 5 times a maximum depth of the gate trench. More details and aspects are mentioned in connection with the embodiments described above or below. The semiconductor device shown in 7 may comprise one or more optional additional features corresponding to one or more aspects mentioned in connection with the proposed concept of one or more embodiments described above or below 1-6 and/or 8-9. 8 shows a flow chart of a method for forming a silicon carbide device according to an embodiment. The method 800 may comprise forming 810 a body region of a transistor cell in a silicon carbide substrate and forming 820 a source region of the transistor cell in the silicon carbide substrate. Further, the method 800 may comprise forming 830 a titanium carbide gate electrode of the transistor cell. The body region and the source region of the transistor cell may be formed by implanting dopants and/or by growth epitaxial growth of doped silicon carbide material. The body region and/or the source region of the transistor cell may be formed before the titanium carbide gate electrode. The titanium carbide gate electrode may be a trench gate electrode located in a gate trench or a lateral gate electrode located on a surface of the silicon carbide substrate. For example, the method 800 may additionally comprise forming a gate trench extending from a surface of the silicon carbide substrate into the silicon carbide substrate. To generate a highly conductive gate electrode, the use of titanium carbide may be proposed. For example, titanium carbide has a very good electrical conductivity metallic performance and substantially improved electrical conductivity as compared to doped polysilicon and has a melting point of 3140 C. , but it is stable under the influence of air oxygen rich atmosphere only up to 800 C. Due to the high melting point, the subsequent processing might not be subject to any limitations, if the TiC material is encapsulated. This might be ensured, if the inter layer dielectric ILD deposition directly follows the gate deposition and patterning, for example. For example, for SiC devices all or most doping regions may be already generated before the gate insulation layer, since the required high activation temperatures of often &gt;1600 C. may otherwise lead to a damage of the gate insulation layer and/or the interface passivation. For example, substantially no high-temperature process may be necessary after the TiC deposition a phosphosilicate glass PSG annealing in N2 at 800 C. and/or contact annealing by rapid thermal processing RTP at 1000 C. may be the highest temperatures. Further, in comparison to the deposition of TiN, a chlorine precursor might not be necessary for forming the TiC. Consequently, it may be possible to avoid damages caused by the usage of chlorine. In comparison to the metal system of TiN and W, the overall process temperature may be lower for forming the complete trench gate. Titanium carbide may be deposited by physical vapor deposition PVD titanium and methane and/or chemical vapor deposition CVD titanium tetrachloride and methane. Alternatively, TiC may be formed by a direct synthesis of the two elements by depositing both a carbon layer graphite and a titanium layer and subsequently generating titanium carbide under the influence of a high temperature from approx. 900 C. to 1000 C. . The required temperature budget may be comparatively low and thus may minimize negative influences on the gate insulation layer already passivated before. In order to avoid a possible damage of the oxide by the titanium deposition, the carbon layer may be deposited before the titanium layer. Possible titanium residues after the formation of titanium carbide may be chemically removed. For example, chemical removal may be performed with an etchant that does not attack titanium carbide as compared to titanium. One example of such an etchant is sulfuric acid. As mentioned, the manufacturing of titanium carbide may be done in various possible ways. For example, TiC may be deposited by PVD or CVD on a gate insulation layer located on the silicon carbide substrate. Alternatively, the forming 830 of the titanium carbide gate electrode may comprise forming a carbon layer, forming a titanium layer and/or a titanium oxide layer on the carbon layer and annealing, after forming the titanium layer, to obtain the titanium carbide gate electrode. The annealing may be performed at a temperature of at most 1100 C. or at most 1050 C. or at most 1000 C. and/or of at least 800 C. or at least 900 C. or at least 950 C. . Additionally, the forming 830 of the titanium carbide gate electrode may comprise oxidizing by an anodic oxidation the titanium layer before the annealing. For example, titanium may be deposited onto an existing carbon layer previously formed on the gate insulation layer. To generate thicker titanium carbide layers and simultaneously keep the time in the temperature process low, titanium and carbon may be deposited alternatingly. In other words, the forming of a carbon layer and the forming at least one of a titanium layer and a titanium oxide layer may be repeated alternatingly to form a layer stack of alternating carbon and at least one of titanium layers and titanium oxide layers. The stoichiometry Ti:C1:1 may be considered for forming the TiC. For example, if the TiC material arises from a titanium layer and a carbon layer, achieving a stoichiometric ratio of Ti:C1:1 may require that a layer thickness of the titanium layer is approximately twice the layer thickness of the carbon layer i. e. , the ratio of the layer thicknesses is Ti:C2:1. This may be due to the fact that the density of titanium is approximately twice the density of carbon. In the subsequent furnace process in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of 900 C. -1200 C. titanium carbide may be formed. Excess titanium may be chemically removed for example using sulfuric acid. Alternatively to the reaction of the pure elements, titanium carbide may also be formed from the reaction of titanium dioxide and carbon as pure titanium might not be formed. TiO2+2C-&gt;TiC+CO2 Titanium dioxide may, for example, be deposited by means of atomic layer deposition ALD, CVD, PVD or Spin On. For example, a trench device device with TiC gate electrode in a gate trench may be formed by at least the following process steps in the order as follows any additional intermediate steps may be possible: Providing a SiC substrate comprising a doped epitaxial layer so-called buffer layer and a more lightly doped epitaxial layer Forming of doping regions body and source regions Etching of the gate trench, post processing of the gate trench sidewall and rounding of the gate trench bottom Optionally, forming of sacrificial oxide Forming of the gate insulation layer Post annealing of the gate insulation layer Forming of the TiC gate electrode Encapsulating the TiC gate electrode by an oxide layer formed by tetraethylorthosilicate or by a polysilicon layer Forming of an ILD, formation of contacts and metallization deposition and structuring of one or more metal layers to form source and gate metallization. Summarizing, the reaction Ti+C-&gt;TiC may take place at temperatures of more than 1200 C. or more than 1000 C. A carbon layer having a thickness between 100 nm and 300 nm may be formed on a semiconductor substrate a silicon substrate or a SiC substrate and a titanium layer having a thickness between 200 nm and 500 nm may be formed on the carbon layer. The layers may be annealed in an inert atmosphere N2 at a temperature of at least 600 C. , at least 800 C. and/or at least 1000 C. to form a TiC layer. Alternatively, titanium oxide TiO2 may be formed as an intermediate product. For example, TiO2 may be formed via oxidation i. e. , Ti+O2TiO2. Afterwards, TiC may be formed by the reaction TiO2+2C-&gt;TiC+CO2 in an inert atmosphere in a nitrogen, N2, atmosphere at a temperature of at least 600 C. , at least 800 C. and/or at least 1000 C. . The oxidation may take place in an environment comprising oxygen so-called oxidating environment, at a temperature of at least 500 C. and/or at least 700 C. The environment may comprise oxygen. In particular, an amount of oxygen in the environment may be at least an amount required for forming stoichiometric TiO2 , the amount of oxygen atoms may at least be twice the amount of titanium atoms to be oxidized. In addition to oxygen, the environment may comprise an inert gas , nitrogen or argon. For example, the environment may be air. Alternatively, the oxidation may be done by anodic oxidation, for example in water H2O or a diluted mineral acid , phosphoric acid and/or sulfuric acid as an electrolyte. For small structural sizes pitch minimizing stripe structures may be used and the use of highly conductive gate electrodes may enable a substantial reduction of chip area due to the omission of otherwise required gate finger structures. Further, the switching behavior may be homogenized across the chip due to the lower voltage drop along the stripes in the field plates and gates, which may prevent the occurrence of undesired critical states local dynamic avalanches and/or parasitic restart and thus may enable higher switching frequencies. More details and aspects are mentioned in connection with the embodiments described above or below. The method shown in 8 may comprise one or more optional additional features corresponding to one or more aspects mentioned in connection with the proposed concept of one or more embodiments described above or below 1-7 or 9. 9 shows a flow chart of a method for forming a semiconductor device according to an embodiment. The method 900 may comprise forming 910 a body region of a transistor cell in a semiconductor substrate and forming 920 a source region of the transistor cell in the semiconductor substrate. Further, the method 900 may comprise forming 930 a titanium carbide field electrode of the transistor cell. The titanium carbide field electrode may be connected or connectable to a reference voltage metallization structure so that a reference voltage independent from a gate voltage of the transistor cell is providable to the titanium carbide field electrode. To generate a highly conductive field plate and/or gate electrode the use of titanium carbide may be proposed. Titanium carbide has a very good electrical conductivity metallic performance and substantially improved electrical conductivity as compared to doped polysilicon and has a melting point of 3140 C. , and it is stable under the influence of air oxygen rich atmosphere up to 800 C. Due to the high melting point, the subsequent processing might not be subject to any limitations, if the TiC material is encapsulated. When used as a field plate electrode, this might be ensured by the insulation oxide for the gate electrode for example, deposited tetraethylorthosilicate or high-density plasma oxides may be used. In contrast to the material system titanium nitride and tungsten, subsequent high-temperature processes may be enabled, for example, for the gate insulation layer block a SACOX and the actual GOX either as a grown oxide or also as a deposited oxide with a subsequent densification each at temperatures around 1100 C. to ensure a good oxide quality. Titanium carbide may be deposited by PVD titanium methane and/or CVD titanium tetrachloride and methane. Alternatively, a direct synthesis of the two elements may be used by depositing both a carbon layer for example graphite and a titanium layer and subsequently generating titanium carbide under the influence of a temperature of approximately 900 C. . In order to avoid a possible damage of the oxide by titanium deposition, the carbon layer may be deposited first and subsequently the titanium. Possible titanium residues may be chemically removed by sulfuric acid after the formation of titanium carbide. As mentioned, the manufacturing of titanium carbide may be done in various possible ways. For example, titanium may be deposited onto an existing carbon layer. To generate thicker titanium carbide layers and simultaneously keep the time in the temperature process low, titanium and carbon may be deposited alternatingly. For deposition of a carbon layer and a titanium layer, the stoichiometry Ti:C1:1 may be considered. For example, a ratio of the layer thicknesses of Ti:C2:1 may be required. In the subsequent oven process inert, 900 C. -1200 C. titanium carbide may be formed. Excess titanium may be removed using sulfuric acid. Alternatively to the reaction of the pure elements, titanium carbide may also be formed from the reaction of titanium dioxide and carbon. TiO2+2C-&gt;TiC+CO2 A field plate trench MOSFET may be formed by at least the following processes in the basic order as follows any additional intermediate steps may be possible: Providing a silicon Si substrate with epitaxial layers Etching the field plate trench and if applicable trench rounding using rounding oxide Forming field oxide Forming TiC field plate electrode Etchback of the field plate electrode Encapsulation of the field plate electrode with an oxide etc. Optionally forming a sacrificial oxide Forming the gate insulation layer Forming of the TiC gate electrode Encapsulation of the gate electrode by a thin oxide Forming of the necessary doping regions source region Forming ILD Contact formation and metallization If the TiC field plate electrode and the TiC gate electrode are located in separate trenches, the gate trench may be formed before the formation of the sacrificial oxide. For example, the etchback of the field plate electrode may be optional. Further, the gate trench may be formed before the field plate trench or vice versa. Due to the low structural sizes for power devices in the field of low-voltage power MOSFETs 40V, stripe structures may be used and highly conductive field plates may offer the possibility of a considerate reduction of chip area due to avoiding otherwise required finger structures. Further, the switching behavior may be homogenized across the chip due to the lower voltage drop along the stripes in the field plates and gates, which might prevent the occurrence of undesired critical states local dynamic avalanches and thus may enable higher switching frequencies. For example, in the field of CPU voltage regulators these devices may be used in integrated systems and may enable higher power densities.
