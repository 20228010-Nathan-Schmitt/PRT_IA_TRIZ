                    "DESCRIPTION": "The following detailed description of the present disclosure refers to the accompanying drawings that show, byway of illustration, specific embodiments in which the present disclosure is practiced. These embodiments may be described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present disclosure. It can be understood that the various embodiments of the present disclosure are different but need not be mutually exclusive. For example, certain shapes, structures, and characteristics described in one embodiment may be embodied in other embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure with respect to the one embodiment. In addition, it can be understood that the location or arrangement of individual components within each disclosed embodiment may be changed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure may be defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims may be entitled. Like reference numerals in the drawings refer to the same or similar functions or elements throughout the several aspects. Hereinafter, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings such that those skilled in the art may easily implement the present disclosure. 1A is a view illustrating an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, and 2A is a view illustrating a connection relationship between components of an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to 1A and 2A, an apparatus for controlling batteries 100a according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure may control sizes of first and second currents I1 and I2 according to an output current IO flowing from an output unit 50 to a load 40. In this case, the output current IO may correspond to the sum of first current I1 of a first battery 10 and second current I2 of a second battery 20. The apparatus for controlling batteries 100a may control the first and second currents I1 and I2 through control of the first battery 10 and the second battery 20. The first battery 10 and the second battery 20 may have different characteristics , rated voltage, rated capacity, electrical stability, physical/chemical durability, size, . For example, the first battery 10 may increase the size of the first current I1 relatively easily, and may be configured to stably provide the first current I1 to the load 40 as it has a high capacity. For example, the first battery 10 may be configured to include a liquid electrolyte, and may have a relatively high energy density or be manufactured relatively inexpensively on an energy unit basis, as compared to the second battery 20. Therefore, the first battery 10 may relatively easily supply the load 40 with the first current I1 higher than the second current I2 of the second battery 20. For example, the second battery 20 may flexibly provide the second current I2, which may be a relatively low current, to the load 40, and may be miniaturized with high stability/durability relatively easily. For example, the second battery 20 may be configured to include a solid electrolyte, may have characteristics that may be relatively resistant to temperature changes and external shocks, relative to the first battery 10, and may deal with the change of the second current I2 supplied to the load 40 more efficiently, based on a stable state of the solid electrolyte. The apparatus for controlling batteries 100a may control the first battery 10 and the second battery 20 having different characteristics in different principles and/or manners, to efficiently combine the first and second currents having different characteristics to provide the output current IC. Referring to 1A and 2A, a first current sensor 110, a first current limiter 120, and a second current activator 130 may be included. For example, the first current sensor 110, the first current limiter 120, and the second current activator 130 may be configured as a single integrated circuit IC, may be configured in the form of a single IC together with a power management circuit, or may be composed of a plurality of ICs. The first current sensor 110 may be configured to sense the first current I1 flowing from the first battery 10 to the output unit 50. The first current limiter 120 may be configured to limit an increase in the first current I1 by using sensing results of the first current sensor 110, when the first current I1 exceeds a reference current , 3A. The second current activator 130 may be configured to draw the second current I2 of the second battery 20 to the output unit 50, based on the limit operation of the first current limiter 120. For example, when a magnitude of the output current IO is equal to or lower than a reference current, the apparatus for controlling batteries 100a may substantially control the first and second batteries 10 and 20 such that only the first battery 10 supplies the first current I1 to the load 40. For example, when a magnitude of the output current IO is greater than a reference current, the apparatus for controlling batteries 100a may control the first battery 10 and the second battery 20, to allow the first battery 10 to supply the load 40 with the first current I1 having the same magnitude as that of the reference current, and to allow the second battery 20 to supply the load 40 with the second current I2 corresponding to the rest of the output current IO except for the first current I1. Therefore, since the apparatus for controlling batteries 100a may limit the size of the first current I1 from becoming too high, the apparatus for controlling batteries 100a may easily extend the lifespan of the first battery 10, may reduce the size of the first battery 10 more easily according to the relaxation of the specifications , maximum current, rated capacity required for the batteries, and may further improve the safety of the first battery 10 , explosion potential in high temperature environments. In addition, the apparatus for controlling batteries 100a may provide the load 40 with a relatively high output current IO regardless of the maximum current and/or rated capacity of the second battery 20. In addition, since the load 40 may be flexibly provided with a wide range of output current IO without substantially inducing a shortening of the lifespan of the first battery 10, it is possible to efficiently perform various circuit operations or deal efficiently with various energy demands. For example, the load 40 may be smoothly provided with a relatively high output current IO to prevent distortion of the signal used , rising/falling speed limits, rising/falling saturation, etc. of the pulse waveform. 1B is a view illustrating a structure in which the number of batteries is greater than that of the apparatus for controlling batteries illustrated in 1A. Referring to 1B, the apparatus for controlling batteries according to an example embodiment may further control third batteries 31, 32, and 33. The second current activator 130 may be configured to draw a third current of the third batteries 31, 32, and 33 electrically connected to the second battery 20 to the output unit 50, based on the limit operation of the first current limiter 120. When the third batteries 31, 32, and 33 are connected to the second battery 20 in parallel, a magnitude of the output current provided to the load may be greater, even without substantially increasing the first current of the first battery 10. When the third batteries 31, 32, and 33 are connected to the second battery 20 in series, the total voltages of the second battery 20 and the third batteries 31, 32, and 33 may be higher than a second voltage of the second battery 20. Therefore, when a first voltage of the first battery 10 is relatively high, the total voltages of the second battery 20 and the third batteries 31, 32, and 33 may be more easily matched to the first voltage. 1C is a view illustrating a structure in which a voltage adjuster is added to the apparatus for controlling batteries illustrated in 1A. Referring to 1C, the apparatus for controlling batteries according to an example embodiment may further include a voltage adjuster 140. The voltage adjuster 140 may be configured to adjust the second voltage such that the second voltage of the second battery 20 is closer to the first voltage of the first battery 10. For example, the voltage adjuster 140 may be implemented as a boost DC-DC converter circuit or a charge pump circuit, and may support charge/discharge between the first battery 10 and the second battery 20. As the second voltage of the second battery 20 is closer to the first voltage of the first battery 10, a rate of change in a voltage of the load according to a change in magnitude of the second current of the second battery 20 may be smaller. Therefore, the load may stably receive a relatively high output current from the first and second batteries 10 and 20, and may prevent operation of a low voltage protection circuit or the like that may be linked to the load. 1D is a view illustrating an electronic device including batteries, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to 1D, an electronic device including batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a substrate 60, a first battery 10, a second battery 20, and a battery controller 100b. For example, a type of electronic device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a smartphone, a personal digital assistant, a digital video camera, a digital still camera, a network system, a computer, a monitor, a tablet, a laptop, a netbook, a television, a video game, a smart watch, an automotive, etc. , but is not limited thereto. The substrate 60 may provide an arrangement space of a load 40. For example, the substrate 60 may have a structure in which wirings and insulating layers are alternately stacked, such as a printed circuit board PCB, and may have a first wiring electrically connecting the load 40 and the battery controller 100b, and a second wiring electrically connecting the second battery 20 and the battery controller 100b. For example, the load 40 may be a portion or peripheral component of a central processing unit CPU or an application processor, and may generate digital and/or analog signals based on an output current supplied from the first battery 10 and/or the second battery 20, or information may be processed/output based on the signals. For example, the signal and/or information may be transferred to a communications modem, a high frequency circuit, or the like to be used for communication, or may be transferred to a display device or an image processing unit to be used for display. For example, the load 40 may adjust the output current of the battery controller 100b through a power management integrated circuit PMIC, but is not limited thereto. The first battery 10 may provide first electric power to the load 40, and may include a liquid electrolyte. The second battery 20 may be mounted on the substrate 60, and may include a solid electrolyte. The battery controller 100b may correspond to an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The battery controller 100b may be configured to cut off second electric power provided from the second battery 20 to the load 40, when an input current of the load 40 is lower than or equal to a reference current. The battery controller 100b may be configured to activate the supply of the second electric power to the load 40, when an input current of the load 40 exceeds a reference current. Therefore, since the load 40 may be flexibly provided with a wide range of output currents without substantially inducing a shortening of the lifespan of the first battery 10, it is possible to efficiently perform various circuit operations or deal efficiently with various energy demands. For example, the load 40 may be smoothly provided with a relatively high output current to prevent distortion of the signal used , rising/falling speed limits, rising/falling saturation, etc. of the pulse waveform. For example, the electronic device including batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may improve the substantial performance of the load 40, even without substantially shortening the lifespan of the first battery 10, to ensure performance of applications , communication, display, big data management, , and may improve the stability and durability of the first and second batteries 10 and 20 to have improved stability and durability of the electronic device. Referring to 1A to 1D, the apparatus for controlling batteries 100a and/or the battery controller 100b according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a first positive electrode connecting portion LB+, a first negative electrode connecting portion LB, a second positive electrode connecting portion SB+, and a second negative electrode connecting portion SB. The first positive electrode connecting portion LB+ may be configured to connect a positive electrode of the first battery 10. The first negative electrode connecting portion LB may be configured to connect a negative electrode of the first battery 10. The second positive electrode connecting portion SB+ may be configured to connect a positive electrode of the second battery 20. The second negative electrode connecting portion SB may be configured to connect a negative electrode of the second battery 20. For example, the first battery 10 and the second battery 20 may be electrically connected to the apparatus for controlling batteries 100a and/or the battery controller 100b through different electrical paths. Therefore, since the first battery 10 and the second battery 20 may be arranged in positions suitable for each other in the electronic device, a degree of freedom in which the first battery 10 and the second battery 20 in the electronic device are arranged may be improved. For example, when the first battery 10 has a relatively large size, the first battery 10 may disposed to be separated from the substrate 60. For example, when the battery controller 100b and the second battery 20 are electrically connected to the substrate 60, the second positive electrode connecting portion SB+ and the second negative electrode connecting portion SB may be connected to the positive electrode and the negative electrode of the second battery 20 through a plurality of different wires of the substrate 60, respectively. 2B is a circuit diagram illustrating an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to 2B, an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a first current sensor 110a, a first current limiter 120a, and a second current activator 130a. A first battery 10a and a second battery 20a may be controlled according to an output current supplied to a load 40a. The first battery 10a may be modeled by a combination of first and second capacitors C1 and C2, zero, first, and second resistors R0, R1, and R2, and an open circuit voltage Voc. The second battery 20a may be modeled by a combination of a third capacitor Cs and a third resistor Rs. The load 40a may be modeled by a combination of a maximum resistor Rmax, a minimum resistor Rmin, and switches ton and toff, and may be connected to an output unit 50. The first current sensor 110a may include a current transformer that generates a sensing current based on a first current. A primary side CT11 of the current transformer may be electrically connected between the first battery 10a and the load 40a, and a secondary side CT12 of the current transformer may be electrically connected to the first current limiter 120a. The first current limiter 120a may include an impedance element RCT that provides a sensing voltage corresponding to the sensing current flowing in the secondary side CT12 of the current transformer. The first current limiter 120a may include a diode U1 which may be in a breakdown state when the sensing voltage reaches a reference voltage corresponding to a reference current. For example, the diode U1 may be a Zener diode. When a reverse bias is applied to the diode U1 and the sensing voltage does not reach the reference voltage, a current of the diode U1 may be very lower. When a reverse bias is applied to the diode U1 and the sensing voltage reaches the reference voltage, a current of the diode U1 may increase rapidly according to the breakdown state of the diode U1. In addition, when the diode U1 is in the breakdown state, a rate of change in voltage according to a change in current of the diode U1 may be very small. The first current limiter 120a may include a current limiting transistor M1 that receives a voltage of the diode U1 through a gate terminal. When the diode U1 is in the breakdown state, the voltage of the diode U1 may hardly change. Therefore, a current flowing between a drain terminal and a source terminal of the current limiting transistor M1 may hardly change. The current limiting transistor M1 may use a path between the drain terminal and the source terminal as a path through which a current corresponding to the first current of the first battery 10a flows. When the diode U1 is in the breakdown state, a current flowing between the drain terminal and the source terminal of the current limiting transistor M1 may hardly change. Therefore, an increase in the first current of the first battery 10a may be limited. For example, the first current limiter 120a may be configured to limit an increase in the first current of the first battery 10a by using a breakdown voltage of the diode U1. The current of the diode U1 may be transferred to the second current activator 130a through a driving resistor RM. The second current activator 130a may include a current activating transistor Q2 that receives the current of the diode U1 through a base terminal. The current activating transistor Q2 may use a path between an emitter terminal and a collector terminal as an electrical path between the second battery 20 and the output unit 50. When the diode U1 is not in the breakdown state, a base current of the base terminal of the current activating transistor Q2 may be very small, and a current between the emitter terminal and the collector terminal of the current activating transistor Q2 may also be relatively small. Therefore, the current activating transistor Q2 may block the electrical path between the second battery 20 and the output unit 50. When the diode U1 is in the breakdown state, abase current of the base terminal of the current activating transistor Q2 may be relatively high, and a current between the emitter terminal and the collector terminal of the current activating transistor Q2 may also be relatively high. Therefore, the current activating transistor Q2 may activate the electrical path between the second battery 20 and the output unit 50. As a result, the second current activator 130a may transfer the second current of the second battery 20 to the output unit 50, based on a first current increase limit operation of the first current limiter 120a. The current limiting transistor M1 may be a field effect transistor, and the current activating transistor Q2 may be a bipolar junction transistor BJT, but are not limited thereto. For example, the current activating transistor Q2 may be composed of other types of transistors that operate based on the current of the base terminal. 2C is a circuit diagram illustrating an equivalent circuit of the first current limiter illustrated in 2B, when a first current is lower than or equal to a reference current. Referring to 2C, when an output current IO or a first current I1 is lower than or equal to a reference current IR, a voltage VB of the diode Dl may not reach a reference voltage VR and a current IB of a diode Dl may be close to OA. Therefore, a second current I2 may also be close to almost OA, and the output current IO and the first current I1 may be substantially the same. 2D is a circuit diagram illustrating an equivalent circuit of the first current limiter illustrated in 2B, when a first current exceeds a reference current. Referring to 2D, when an output current IO or a first current I1 exceeds a reference current IR, a diode may operate as a constant voltage source VS according to a breakdown state. Therefore, a change in voltage VB of the diode may be limited, and an increase in the first current I1 may be limited. In addition, since a current IB of the diode may be changed more freely, the current IB of the diode may be higher than OA, and a second current I2 may also be higher than OA. Therefore, the output current IO may have a magnitude corresponding to the sum of the first current I1 which may be almost unchanged and the second flexible current I2 which may flow. In addition, an operation of the constant voltage source VS according to the breakdown state of the diode may also support an operation , charging/discharging of charge of a voltage adjuster 140. 2E is a circuit diagram illustrating a voltage based operating structure of the first current limiter and the second current activator illustrated in 2D. Referring to 2E, a second current activator 130b may be implemented with a second field effect transistor M2 according to a design. Therefore, a type of transistor included in the second current active portion 130b is not particularly limited. In this case, a gate terminal of the second field effect transistor M2 may be connected to a diode gate resistor RB, a ground resistor RC, and the diode gate resistor RB may be connected to a ground. Other currents in a constant voltage source VS based on a breakdown state of a diode may flow to the ground through the diode gate resistor RB and the ground resistor RC, and a voltage between the diode gate resistor RB and the gate terminal may correspond to a current of the diode. 2F is a circuit diagram illustrating an active control structure of an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to 2F, an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure further may include a controller 150 generating a control signal VC based on a sensing result VD of a first current sensor 110b. For example, an operating principle of the first current sensor 110b is not limited to a breakdown voltage. A first current limiter 120b may be configured to select whether to limit an increase in first current of a first battery 10a according to the control signal VC. For example, the first current limiter 120b may include a switch T1 in which an on/off state is determined according to the control signal VC. In this case, the switch T1 may be configured as a transistor to determine whether to activate an electrical path between a drain terminal and a source terminal according to the control signal VC input to a gate terminal. 2G is a circuit diagram illustrating a structure in which a voltage adjuster of an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure is omitted. Referring to 2G, a voltage adjuster of the apparatus for controlling batteries according to an example embodiment may be omitted. For example, when first and second voltages of first and second batteries 10a and 20a are similar to each other, the voltage adjuster may be easily omitted. For example, when voltage stability required in a load 40a is relatively low or when the load 40a further includes an auxiliary structure that mitigates a variation in voltage, the voltage adjuster may be easily omitted. 2H is a circuit diagram illustrating the apparatus for controlling batteries illustrated in 1B. Referring to 2H, an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may selectively provide a load 40a with a current of third batteries 31, 32, and 33 according to whether a second current activator 130a is activated. For example, the number of batteries in a circuit structure of the apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is not particularly limited. 3 is a graph illustrating changes in first and second currents of first and second batteries according to changes in current flowing to a load of an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to 3, when the total current IO supplied to a load increases to a maximum current Imax during increased time TL, a first current I1 of a first battery may increase up to a reference current IR, and a second current I2 of a second battery may increase from a moment in which the first current I1 increases to the reference current IR. 4A is a side view illustrating a second battery that is a control target of an apparatus for controlling batteries according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Referring to 4A, a second battery 20a may include a solid electrolyte 21, an internal positive electrode 22a, an internal negative electrode 22b, a positive electrode blocking portion 23a, a negative electrode blocking portion 23b, a positive electrode margin portion 24a, a negative electrode margin portion 24b, an external positive electrode 25a, and an external negative electrode 25b. The internal positive electrode 22a may be disposed on one of upper and lower surfaces of the solid electrolyte 21. The internal negative electrode 22b may be disposed on the other/opposing of the upper and lower surfaces of the solid electrolyte 21. For example, the internal positive electrode 22a and the internal negative electrode 22b may be alternately stacked with the solid electrolyte 21 interposed therebetween. For example, the internal negative electrode 22b and the internal positive electrode 22a may include a ceramic oxide-based material, but are not limited thereto. For example, the solid electrolyte 21 may serve as a region in which lithium ions move between the internal positive electrode 22a and the internal negative electrode 22b, and may include a ceramic oxide-based material, but is not limited thereto. For example, the solid electrolyte 21, the internal positive electrode 22a, and the internal negative electrode 22b may be calcined after being stacked in a slurry state or a paste state. The slurry may be stacked by a doctor blade method or the like, and the paste may be printed in a predetermined form by a screen-printing method, a gravure printing method, or the like. The external positive electrode 25a may be connected to the internal positive electrode 22a, and may be disposed on a first side surface of the solid electrolyte 21. The external negative electrode 25b may be connected to the internal negative electrode 22b, and may be disposed on a second side surface of the solid electrolyte 21. For example, the external positive electrode 25a and the external negative electrode 25b may include a noble metal , Pt, Au, Ag, or the like, but are not limited thereto, may be configured to include metals such as Cu, Pd, Pb, Ni, Sn, or the like, and may include a plating layer. External surfaces of the external positive electrode 25a and the external negative electrode 25b may contact solder paste, and may be electrically connected to a substrate such as a PCB through the solder paste. The solder paste may be hardened in a state in which an all-solid-state battery 110 is mounted on a substrate. 4B is a perspective view illustrating a mounting on a substrate of the second battery illustrated in 4A. Referring to 4B, the external positive electrode 25a and the external negative electrode 25b of the second battery 20a may be arranged on upper surfaces of first and second electrical connection structures 61a and 61b, respectively. The first and second electrical connection structures 61a and 61b may be arranged on a substrate 60. In this case, the external positive electrode 25a and the external negative electrode 25b may be fixed to the first and second electrical connection structures 61a and 61b, respectively, by tin or an alloy-based solder containing tin. 5 is a flowchart illustrating control of an apparatus for controlling batteries and/or an electronic device according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Although a significant amount of research has been done on developing new battery materialsespecially lithium ion intercalation materialsfilm deposition methodologies have remained relatively unchanged. Once anode or cathode powder materials are acquired, conventional deposition involves the production of a slurry that contains the appropriate mixture of intercalation, conduction, and binder particles. The slurry is then coated onto the suitable electrode metal sheeting, which is subsequently heated for solvent evaporation and transferred into a controlled atmosphere for assembly into battery. This multiple step process is time consuming, costly, and sufficiently labor intensive that outsourcing production is a necessity for long-term financial viability. Only a few other methods have been investigated as potential replacements for the slurry coating process for lithium ion batteries. Some of these are relatively expensive, such as pulsed laser deposition, vapor deposition, and sputtering. Other more economically feasible options include electrostatic spray deposition ESD C. H. Chen et al. , Solid State Ionics 86: 1301-1306, 1996. , and electrophoretic deposition EPD H. Mazor et al. , J. Power Sources 198: 264-272, 2012. These methods include a liquid phase, thereby ensuring a multistep method. ESD involves electrostatic deposition of charged precursor solution droplets that impinge and react on a hot, grounded substrate. EPD involves the migration of charged particles onto a grounded substrate in a liquid. Less time consuming and labor intensive methods would be desired for the production of particle films for batteries and other products. Thermal runaway is one of the biggest dangers of the lithium ion battery. At a certain temperature, a self-sustaining reaction will occur, leading to catastrophic failure. Although some battery chemistries require higher temperatures to initiate thermal runaway, it is possible for all lithium batteries. Lithium batteries will generate heat due to the chemical reaction between anode and cathode, and internal electrical resistance. If the heat generation is equal to the heat flux out of the battery, then there will be no rise in temperature. In a standard lithium ion cylindrical cell as shown in 7, the metal foils are connected to the battery terminals by a small tab. This tab is sufficient for the current to pass through, but provides a poor conduit for heat flow. Further, for heat to be transferred through the tab, it must spiral outward through the entire battery. This means that the heat must travel through meters of foil in order to cross centimeters of space. In order for heat to transfer radially, it must pass through thermally resistive layers of anode powder, polymer separator, and cathode powder.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "As embodied and broadly described herein, the disclosures herein provide detailed embodiments of the invention. However, the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms. Therefore, there is no intent that specific structural and functional details should be limiting, but rather the intention is that they provide a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention. Conventional particle film deposition methodology has focused on automation to increase yields. Reduced yield and also batch-to-batch variations remain a bane to the lithium ion battery industry. It has been surprisingly discovered that yield can be increased and batch-to-batch variation minimized by the methodologies of the invention, and in particular, by co-aerosolization of a conductive particle and a binder. The conductive particles and binder are preferably aerosolized separately and mixed together in the aerosol phase prior to deposition. The process of the invention is not limited to battery chemistry, nor is the chemistry limited to the deposition process. Powder aerosolization can be combined with electrostatic powder deposition to produce nearly any particle film. Accordingly, the processes of the invention can be utilized in a wide variety products and methods that relate to particle deposition. Particle deposition involves an application of particles to a surface. Particles are preferably nanoparticles, which are nanometers to tens of microns in grain size, or nanoparticle agglomerates. Reel-to-reel film deposition allows for the potential of in-situ battery assembly, so that coated electrodes may be prepared and assembled in the same controlled atmosphere. The resulting automated large-area deposition also facilitates the reliable production of large high-current, single-cells. Electrostatic powder coating EPC was first developed in the 1950's as a means for creating uniform large-area particle films. The process has only been commercialized on a more widespread basis over the last two decades A. G. Bailey, J. Electrostatics 45: 85-120, 1998. The basic principle is to charge aerosolized particles, either by a corona gun or by friction caused by flow of the particles through a TEFLON tube, and to aerodynamically carry and deposit the charged particles on a surface. The surface preferably is electrically grounded or has an opposite charge to the charge of the particles, so that the particles follow electric field lines to the surface where they remain adhered due to the electrostatic attractive forces between the particle and surface. Preferably, the surface is a metal capable of conducting a charge, however the surface can be of another material, such as plastic, fiber, or other naturally occurring or manmade materials capable of conducting a charge. Current applications of the process are generally followed by a high temperature melting and curing step, forming the final continuous film. Constraints on the size and electrical properties of the particles have previously limited the industrial use of the process to environmentally friendly , no solvents painting and epoxy coating. The conventional constraints on the particle properties preclude the application of EPC to nano-sized particles and to particles that are either too conductive or too electrically resistive. There are resistivity limits because of the required electrostatic adhesive interaction between the particle and surface after deposition has occurred. While paint particles typically used in EPC stick to the substrate via electrostatic charges, conductive particles alone will not stick to the substrate due to the rapid loss of charge when the particles come into contact with the grounded substrate. Particles that are too conductive immediately lose their charge to the surface, and are therefore no longer electrostatically bound to the surface. They are then susceptible to aerodynamic re-entrainment in the carrier gas flow. Conversely, particles that are too resistive retain their charge to such an extent that the coated surface itself becomes highly charged. This results in: 1 a significant reduction in the magnitude of the electric field attracting the particles to the surface, and 2 a so-called back ionization effect, whereby electrical gas breakdown occurs within the particle film resulting in a local loss of charge, localized re-entrainment of particles, and thus a non-uniform or orange peel finish. One example of an EPC process used in battery making is 6,511,517 to Ullrich et al. However, the method taught by Ullrich uses EPC merely to create a wax coating on top of the positive electrode or the negative electrode. The application of EPC to conductive nanoparticle films, such as a graphitic carbon anode or a conductive lithium iron phosphate typically coated with carbon cathode, involves film that is bound to a metal sheeting substrate immediately upon deposition. Conventional slurry coating of lithium ion battery electrodes typically employs a polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF binder for adequate film adhesion. The necessary presence of such a chemically inert binder may be exploited to enhance the immediate adhesion of the film to the substrate. 1 depicts a flowchart of an embodiment of a method of the invention. At step 105, preferably a binder is mixed with electrically conductive cathode/anode particles in the aerosol phase. At step 110, heat is applied to the substrate and the substrate is electrically grounded. Preferably, the heat is above the melting point of the binder. At step 115, the mixture of the binder and conductive particles is electrically charged. At step 120, the binder is co-deposited with the cathode/anode particles in a well-mixed fashion. The heated substrate induces sufficient flow of the PVDF to bind the film, despite the rapid loss of charge of the conductive particles, to the grounded substrate. At step 125, the substrate is allowed to cool with the charged particles adhered thereto. The method shown in 1 can be carried out either for a single sided coating, as shown in 4, or for a double sided coating, as shown in 5The anodic or cathodic material is preferably at least one of carbon, lithium titanate, lithium cobalt oxide, lithium manganese oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide, lithium iron phosphate, or lithium iron manganese phosphate. Additional suitable polymer binders include styrene butadiene copolymer SBR, polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE and others which are well-known in the art. Preferably, the binder is non-soluble. A secondary benefit to this mode of EPC deposition is that static charge build-up of insulating film particles is avoided, thus eliminating the self-limiting effects of back ionization. In other words, the film could be grown arbitrarily thick, as compared to conventional EPC applications. Mixing the binder with the cathode or anode powder in the aerosol phase can be performed in variety of ways. For example, binder can be co-aerosolized as dry powder using a turntable dust generator Seshadri et al. , J. Aerosol Sci. 36: 541-547, 2006 or fluidized bed disperser. Alternatively, the binder can be dissolved in a solvent and atomized into microdroplets and mixed with the active powder as an aerosol. Finally, the binder can be vaporized and allowed to condense on the cathode/anode powder grains. When coating a thin metal foil using either the system shown in 4 or 5, convective and radiative heating have proven ineffective because, due to the small specific heat of thin foils, significant cooling begins immediately. This large temperature gradient results in non-uniform deposition and requires the foil be heated significantly above the melting point of the binder so that it doesn't cool below the melting point in the deposition area. This cooling is significantly increased by convection from the air flow required to move the powder onto the foil. The cooling can be partially mitigated by having the heater directly opposite the deposition area, however it is impractical to do this with a double-sided coating, as shown in 5. A double sided coating will have a layer of deposited powder between the heater and the foil which acts as a thermal barrier. This again requires temperatures much higher than the melting point of the binder resulting in non-uniformity and potentially damaging the coating. For thin foils, preferably, the foil is resistively heated during powder deposition by passing an electrical current either AC or DC directly through the metal foil substrate during reel-to-reel deposition. Using this method, heat is preferably generated continuously and uniformly throughout the foil, from below the coating. This preferably results in a small temperature gradient that allows for highly uniform coatings. A continuous reel-to-reel coating system is depicted in 6. The roller on the pre-deposition uncoated side preferably serves as one electrode. The post deposition side passes current through the deposited powder that may have high contact resistance. To solve this, after deposition, the foil is preferably immediately passed through a calendaring press. The calendaring rollers preferably serve as the second electrode with the contact resistance being reduced by the high pressure contact. Preferably, the electrical current passes into and out of the metal rollers using a series of conductive brushes or conductive bearings. The system depicted in 6 has the added benefit of ensuring a conductive path between the powder and the foil, which is important for battery coating applications. The foils created by the system depicted in 6 are preferably adapted for use in lithium ion batteries. The foils can be used in traditional lithium ion batteries, for example the battery depicted in 7, or batteries adapted to dissipate heat at a faster rate than traditional batteries. A battery adapted to quickly dissipate heat preferably increases heat transfer out of the cell by welding metal foils to the battery terminals along their entire length, for example as depicted in 8. Preferably, the battery consists of a cathode, an anode, and polymer separator. Preferably, the metal foils act as both the cathode and the anode and are created by the systems and methods described herein. However other cathodes and anodes can be used. For example the cathode and/or anode can be made of carbon, graphite, metal oxide, a layered oxide, lithium cobalt oxide, a polyanion, lithium iron phosphate, a spinel, lithium manganese oxide, or another material. The polymer separator can be, for example polyethylene or polypropylene. In other embodiments an electrolyte can separate the cathode from the anode. Preferably, the battery design allows heat to flow out through the most thermally conductive part of the battery. In order increase heat dissipation even more, preferably, the shape of the cell is changed from a narrow cylinder to a wide, thin disk. Preferably, the diameter cylinder exceeds the length of the cylinder. Preferably, the ratio of the diameter to the length is greater than 5 to 1, greater that 6 to 1, or greater than 7 to 1. Preferably the cathode, anode, and polymer separator are arranged in a spiral configuration so that many layers of cathode/anode interaction can occur in the same battery. For example, the cross-section of the battery depicted in 8 displays six winds of each the cathode and the anode with eleven polymer separator layers. Preferably, the anode and cathode are formed simultaneously and immediately wound into a battery. The thin disk shape of the pancake-like cell, combined with continuous terminal welding, preferably allows heat to transfer a short distance to easily cooled, high surface area terminals. This cell design is preferably advantageous over standard battery designs in that individual cells can be safely made to much higher capacities than the standard designs. This may provide significant manufacturing cost reduction, especially when combined with a continuous single step production technique.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "The present invention relates to sulfur-based cathode materials for LiS batteries, in particular, to cathode materials prepared from a reaction of elemental liquid sulfur, vinylic comonomers, and WS2 particles.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "An incredible abundance of elemental sulfur, nearly 7-million tons is generated as a waste byproduct from hydrodesulfurization of crude petroleum feedstocks, which converts alkanethiols and other organo sulfur compounds into S8 as described in Chung and which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Before the invention of the inverse vulcanization process, there were only a limited number of synthetic methods available to utilize and modify elemental sulfur. Current industrial utilization of elemental sulfur is centered around sulfuric acid, agrochemicals, and vulcanization of rubber. For example, elemental sulfur is used primarily for sulfuric acid and ammonium phosphate fertilizers, where the rest of the excess sulfur is stored as megaton-sized, above ground sulfur towers. While sulfur feedstocks are plentiful, sulfur is difficult to process. In its original form, elemental sulfur consists of a cyclic molecule having the chemical formulation S8 Elemental sulfur is a brittle, intractable, crystalline solid having poor solid state mechanical properties, poor solution processing characteristics, and there is a limited slate of synthetic methodologies developed for it. Hence, there is a need for the production of new materials that offers significant environmental and public health benefits to mitigate the storage of excess sulfur in powder, or brick form. Elemental sulfur has been explored for use in lithium-sulfur electrochemical cells. Sulfur can oxidize lithium when configured appropriately in an electrochemical cell, and is known to be a very high energy-density cathode material. The poor electrical and electrochemical properties of pure elemental sulfur, such as low cycle stability and poor conductivity have limited the development of this technology. For example, one key limitation of lithium-sulfur technology is the ability to retain high charge capacity for extended numbers of charge-discharge cycles cycle lifetimes. Cells based on present lithium ion technology has low capacity 180 mAh/g but can be cycled for 500-1000 cycles. Lithium-sulfur cells based on elemental sulfur have very high initial charge capacity in excess of 1200 mAh/g, but their capacity drops to below 400 mAh/g within the first 100-500 cycles. Hence, the creation of novel copolymer materials from elemental sulfur feedstocks would be tremendously beneficial in improving sustainability and energy practices. In particular, improved battery technology and materials that can extend cycle lifetimes while retaining reasonable charge capacity will significantly impact the energy and transportation sectors and further mitigate US dependence on fossil fuels. WO2015123552A1 of Pyun teaches LiS batteries fabricated with a MoS2/S8 cathode material. These LiS batteries were able to survive to 1000 charge-discharge cycles while retaining charge capacities around about 400 mAh/g. However, the cathode material required a high content of MoS2 of about 50 wt %, and thus only allowed for lower sulfur loadings of about 50 wt %. The present invention features an improved cathode material utilizing a 2-D inorganic material that inherently possesses high Li-ion conductivity and transport properties, and also enables the use of higher contents of the active sulfur phase. Any feature or combination of features described herein are included within the scope of the present invention provided that the features included in any such combination are not mutually inconsistent as will be apparent from the context, this specification, and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. Additional advantages and aspects of the present invention are apparent in the following detailed description and claims.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "According to some embodiments, the subject disclosure features a composite material comprising at least about 50 wt % sulfur derived from S8, and about 5-50 wt % tungsten sulfide WS2. The composite material may further comprise about 5-10 wt % of one or more comonomers, such as 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene. In one embodiment, the invention features an active material for use in a battery electrode, cathode, may comprise said composite material. Another embodiment of the invention features electrochemical cells comprising an anode comprising lithium, a cathode comprising the composite material, and a non-aqueous electrolyte interposed between the cathode and the anode. Yet a further embodiment of the invention features a method of producing the composite material for use as a cathode in an electrochemical cell. The method may comprise providing about 50 wt % elemental sulfur, adding about 5-50 wt % tungsten sulfide WS2 to the elemental sulfur, thereby forming a composite mixture, and heating and mixing the composite mixture, thereby forming the composite material. The method may further comprise adding one or more comonomers to the composite mixture. One of the unique and inventive technical features of the present invention is the use of an inorganic 2-D material with good Li-ion transporting properties in a composite material that can be prepared into a novel and inexpensive cathode material. Without wishing to limit the invention to any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the technical feature of the present invention advantageously improves LiS battery performance by retaining higher charge capacities while also increasing sulfur loading. None of the presently known prior references or work has the unique inventive technical feature of the present invention.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "As used herein, sulfur can be provided as elemental sulfur, for example, in powdered form. Under ambient conditions, elemental sulfur primarily exists in an eight-membered ring form S8 which melts at temperatures in the range of 120 C. -130 C. and undergoes an equilibrium ring-opening polymerization ROP of the S8 monomer into a linear polysulfane with diradical chain ends. As the person of skill in the art will appreciate, while S8 is generally the most stable, most accessible and cheapest feedstock, many other allotropes of sulfur can be used such as other cyclic allotropes, derivable by melt-thermal processing of S8. Any sulfur species that yield diradical or anionic polymerizing species when heated as described herein can be used in practicing the present invention. As used herein, a styrenic comonomer is a monomer that has a vinyl functional group. The styrenic comonomer may comprise a styrene and at least one reactive functional group. As known to one of ordinary skill in the art, a styrene is a derivative of benzene ring that has a vinylic moiety. The sulfur diradicals can link to the vinylic moieties of the styrenic commoners to form the sulfur-styrenic polymer.

As used herein, an elemental carbon material is a material that is primarily formed as an allotrope of carbon, with a minor amount of chemical modification. For example, graphene, graphene oxide, graphite, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, carbon black, carbon flakes and carbon fibers are examples of elemental carbon materials. As a general guideline for the person of skill in the art, up to about 15 wt % elemental carbon material can be dispersed in sulfur at temperatures high enough such that the sulfur is molten, but low enough that significant ring opening and polysulfide polymerization does not occur , at temperatures in the range of about 120 C. to about 160 C. . Higher loadings of elemental carbon materials in sulfur can be achieved by pre-dissolution of the sulfur and dispersion of the elemental carbon material into a suitable solvent , carbon disulfide followed by removal of the solvent under reduced pressure to yield a blended composite powder. To induce curing of the dispersed carbon, or other nanoinclusions with the sulfur matrix, direct heating of the dispersion to above 160 C. but typically below 200 C. affords a polymerized nanocomposite. As used herein, the term functional in correlation with a polymer refers to functional polymers that have specified physical, chemical, biological, pharmacological, or other properties or uses that are determined by the presence of specific chemical functional groups, which are usually dissimilar to those of the backbone chain of the polymer. As used herein, the terms those defined above and those defined herein when referring to a variable incorporates by reference the broad definition of the variable as well as any narrow and/or preferred definitions, if any.

The use of a new electroactive cathode material for a LiS battery, namely the composite material described herein, upon discharge, generates soluble additive species in situ that co-deposit onto the cathode with lower sulfide discharge products. These additive species may be introduced into the electroactive material during the synthesis of the material, or alternatively added to the electrolyte or battery separator as a soluble species. These additive species are able to co-deposit with sulfide-containing discharge products via active electrochemical reactions, or passive non-electrochemical processes. Without wishing to limit the invention to a particular theory or mechanism, co-deposition of these additive species with sulfide discharge products onto the LiS cathode may plasticize the electrode against mechanical fracture during battery charge-discharge cycling.

In some embodiments, the lower sulfide discharge products are Li2S3, Li2S2, or Li2Without wishing to limit the invention to a particular theory or mechanism, the composite material is effective for providing an electrochemical cell an increased volumetric energy density. For example, the capacity of the electrochemical cell can range from about 500 to about 1400 mAh/g. Further still, the electrochemical cell can have a high retention of charge capacity at fast charge-discharge rates. In some embodiments, the C-rate is about 1 C. For example, a composite material comprising S8 and WS2 may provide for an electrochemical cell having fast charge-discharge rates. As another example, a composite material comprising S8, WS2, and a vinylic comonomer may provide for an electrochemical cell having long cycle lifetimes with higher charge capacity. Without wishing to limit the invention to a particular theory or mechanism, the use of WS2 in the composite material provides for a 2-D inorganic material that inherently possesses a high Li-ion conductivity and transport properties.

The liquid may be substantially nonreactive with the electrolyte, and the anode of the metal-air battery is less reactive with the liquid than with the electrolyte. Upon displacement of the electrolyte from the gap, the liquid may remain in the gap of the metal-air battery to reduce the likelihood of corrosion of the anode and, therefore, reduce the power drain of the battery resulting from such corrosion. To return the metal-air battery to an activated state for generating power, the electrolyte may be moved back into the gap to displace the liquid. A fluid circuit may be in fluid communication with the gap and may displace one of the liquid and the electrolyte in the gap with the other one of the liquid and the electrolyte from the fluid circuit.",
                    "CLAIMS": "1. A system comprising: a metallic anode; an air cathode spaced apart from the metallic anode such that the air cathode and the metallic anode define a gap therebetween; and a fluid circuit in fluid communication with the gap, the fluid circuit including a flowable form of an electrolyte and a liquid, wherein the liquid is substantially immiscible with the flowable form of the electrolyte and is substantially nonreactive with the flowable form of the electrolyte, the metallic anode is less reactive with the liquid than with the flowable form of the electrolyte, and the liquid is movable in the fluid circuit to displace the flowable form of the electrolyte in the fluid circuit. 2. The system of claim 1, wherein the fluid circuit includes a pump actuatable to displace one of the liquid and a flowable form of the electrolyte in the gap with the other one of the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte from the fluid circuit. 3. The system of claim 1, wherein the fluid circuit and the gap define a substantially closed system as the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte are displaced back and forth in the gap. 4. The system of claim 1, further comprising a housing containing the metallic anode and the air cathode, the gap between the metallic anode and the air cathode disposed within the housing. 5. The system of claim 1, wherein the fluid circuit includes a first reservoir that holds one of the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte while the other one of the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte is disposed in the gap. 6.

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "The disclosure generally relates to corrosion mitigation in metal-air batteries.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Metal-air batteries, such as aluminum-air Al-air batteries, may be well-suited for use in battery electric vehicles BEVs due to advantageous characteristics such as having a relatively high pack-level gravimetric energy density compared to other batteries , greater than about 450 watt-hours per kilogram or Wh kg1, and because of the relative abundance, recyclability, low weight, and low cost of metals that can be used in such batteries. However, many metal-air batteries are susceptible to open-circuit anode corrosion, which can cause severe capacity fade when a metal-air battery is deactivated. For example, when an electrolyte is removed from a gap disposed between a metallic anode and an air cathode of the battery, some electrolyte may remain in contact with the metallic anode and, through exposure to air, may corrode the metallic anode.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "Corrosion mitigation in a metal-air battery includes displacing an electrolyte within a gap of the metal-air battery with a liquid. The liquid may be substantially nonreactive with the electrolyte, and the anode of the metal-air battery is less reactive with the liquid than with the electrolyte. Upon displacement of the electrolyte from the gap, the liquid may remain in the gap of the metal-air battery to reduce the likelihood of corrosion of the anode and, therefore, reduce the power drain of the battery resulting from such corrosion. To return the metal-air battery to an activated state for generating power, the electrolyte may be moved back into the gap to displace the liquid.

Further, although the description may emphasize mitigating corrosion in aluminum-air Al-air batteries, it will be understood that the devices, systems, and methods of the present disclosure may include other metal-air batteries including, without limitation, zinc-air Zn-air batteries. For the sake of clarity of explanation, the devices, systems, and methods described herein are generally described in the context of batteries included in a battery electric vehicle. It should be appreciated, however, that the devices, systems, and methods of the present disclosure are generally applicable to batteries in any of various different applications, unless otherwise specified or made clear from the context. By way of example, and not limitation, the devices, systems, and methods of the present disclosure are generally applicable to batteries in power tools, portable electronic devices, generators, portable power systems, spacecraft, electrical appliances, and combinations thereof. 1 is a schematic representation of a battery electric vehicle BEV. In 1, a BEV 102 may include a motor 104, a rechargeable battery 110, and a metal-air battery system 120. The motor 104, the rechargeable battery 110, and the metal-air battery system 120 may be electrically coupled to one another. The rechargeable battery 110 may include, for example, a lithium-ion Li-ion battery, or another electrically rechargeable battery, , connected as a primary power source for the motor 104 of the BEV 102. The metal-air battery system 120 may include a metal-air battery that can charge the rechargeable battery 110 when the electrical production capability of the rechargeable battery 110 reaches a certain threshold amount or otherwise becomes depleted. In this manner, when the BEV 102 is away from a stationary power source for recharging the rechargeable battery 110, the metal-air battery system 120 on board the BEV 102 may act as a range extender that charges the rechargeable battery 110, thus facilitating travel beyond the range of the rechargeable battery 110 alone, which can mitigate range anxiety associated with battery-electric vehicles BEVs. Because the metal-air battery system 120 may be used relatively infrequently , when the rechargeable battery 110 is beyond a depletion threshold and a stationary power source is not available, the metal-air battery system 120 may include a metal-air battery that can be stored for relatively long periods of time between uses and can be mechanically recharged during regular maintenance procedures such as an oil change or tire change of the BEV 102. More specifically, as described in greater detail below, the metal-air battery system 120 may include a liquid and an electrolyte movable in a fluid circuit to displace one another in contact with a metal anode of a metal-air battery to reduce the likelihood of corrosion of the metal anode between uses, , over the course of multiple charging cycles of the rechargeable battery 110. Such a reduction of the likelihood of corrosion of the metal anode can reduce performance degradation of the metal-air battery of the metal-air battery system 120, as compared to metal-air batteries in which a metal anode is stored in air between uses. In general, the BEV 102 may include a terrestrial vehicle, an aerial vehicle, an aquatic vehicle, or combinations thereof. More specifically, the BEV 102 may include an automobile, an airplane, or a boat. Additionally, or alternatively, the BEV 102 may include a manned or an unmanned vehicle , a drone. One or more of the rechargeable battery 110 and the metal-air battery system 120 may provide power to other components of the BEV 102, , in combination with, or instead of, providing power to the motor 104. For example, one or more of the rechargeable battery 110 and the metal-air battery 120 may provide power to non-propulsion related devices of the BEV 102 such as auxiliary electronic components, , a radio, an entertainment system, a light, an auxiliary motor such as for a window or a door, a heating system, a cooling system, and combinations thereof. Also, although two batteries are shown in 1, in certain implementations, the BEV 102 may include only a single battery , a metal-air battery of the metal-air battery system 120, or the BEV 102 may include more than two batteries. The metal-air battery system 120 may include, for example, an Al-air battery. As compared to other types of batteries, the Al-air battery may be useful as a secondary battery in the BEV 102 at least because the Al-air battery has a relatively high pack-level gravimetric energy density. For example, some commercially available Al-air battery packs, such as those designed for military applications, can reach energy densities up to about 467 watt-hours per kilogram Wh kg1. Aluminum is also relatively abundant, recyclable, lightweight, and inexpensive. In general, a discharge reaction for an Al-air battery under closed-circuit conditions may proceed as described in Eqs. 1 and 2 below. O2+2H2O+4e4OHEq. 1 Al+4OHAlOH4+3eEq. 2As shown in Eq. 1, oxygen from outside an Al-air battery may enter the battery , a casing or housing of the battery through an air cathode , an air-breathing cathode where the oxygen reacts with water and electrons to create hydroxides. These hydroxides may then travel through an aqueous electrolyte solution, such as a sodium hydroxide NaOH electrolyte solution or a potassium hydroxide KOH electrolyte solution, until the hydroxides reach an aluminum anode of the Al-air battery. At the anode, the hydroxides may react with the aluminum yielding a waste product, aluminate, and electrons that can perform useful work as outlined in Eq. 2. During both discharge and deactivated conditions in which water remains in contact with the aluminum anode, a parasitic reaction referred to as corrosion may consume the aluminum anode, robbing the Al-air battery of aluminum that otherwise could produce electricity according to the reactions in Eq. 1 and Eq. 2. An example of a corrosion reaction is described below in Eq. 3. 2Al+6H2O2AlOH3+3H2Eq. 3As shown in Eq. 3, ionically conductive water in the electrolyte, which provides for the transport of hydroxides, may react with aluminum to form a waste product, aluminum trihydroxide, and hydrogen gas. As described in greater detail below, the devices, systems, and methods of the present disclosure may reduce the likelihood of corrosion occurring through the reaction in Eq. 3, or analogous corrosion reactions , in other types of metal-air batteries, by interrupting contact between the metal anode and water during a deactivated open-circuit condition in which the metal-air battery is between uses. Thus, as also described in greater detail below, the devices, systems, and methods of the present disclosure can reduce open-circuit corrosion, and the associated rapid capacity fade, as compared to exposing the metal anode to air in between uses. In general, corrosion mitigation devices, systems, and methods of the present disclosure may include displacing a flowable form of an electrolyte within a gap of a metal-air battery with a liquid that is substantially non-reactive with an electrolyte. The metal anode may have less reactivity with the liquid than with the flowable form of the electrolyte. It should be understood that such displacement of the flowable form of the electrolyte from the gap may take place when the metal-air battery is in a deactivated stated, , prior to an initial use or between uses. The liquid may remain in the gap of the metal-air battery to reduce the likelihood of corrosion of the metallic anode and, thus, may reduce a power drain of the metal-air battery, as compared to leaving the metallic anode exposed to the electrolyte and/or air, when the battery is in a deactivated state , a state coinciding with an open circuit condition of the metal-air battery in which electricity production of the metal-air battery is interrupted. To place the metal-air battery in an activated state , a state coinciding with a closed-circuit condition in which electricity can be produced in the metal-air battery, the flowable form of the electrolyte may be moved into the gap to displace the liquid for generating electrical power. Thus, it should be appreciated that the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte can displace one another in the gap of the metal-air battery to facilitate intermittent operation of the metal-air battery over the course of a prolonged period with a reduced degradation in performance, as compared to leaving an electrolyte in contact with a metal anode or leaving the metal anode exposed to air between uses. 2 is a schematic representation of the metal-air battery system 120. As described in greater detail below, the metal-air battery system 120 may mitigate corrosion and capacity fade in a metal-air battery 210 by limiting exposure of portions of the metal-air battery 210 to an electrolyte, air, or both between uses. The metal-air battery system 120 may include a fluid circuit 230 in fluid communication with the metal-air battery 210. The fluid circuit 230 may include a liquid 234 and a flowable form of an electrolyte 232. In use, the liquid 234 may be movable from the fluid circuit 230 to displace the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 present in the metal-air battery 210 when the metal-air battery 210 switches from an activated state to a deactivated state. Additionally, or alternatively, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be movable from the fluid circuit 230 to displace the fluid 234 present in the metal-air battery 120 when the metal-air battery 120 switches from the deactivated state to the activated state. The metal-air battery 210 may include a metallic anode 212 and an air cathode 214 spaced apart from the metallic anode 212, such that the air cathode 214 and the metallic anode 212 define a gap 216 within the metal-air battery 210. The metal-air battery 210 may further, or instead, include a housing 218 disposed about at least a portion of the metallic anode 212, the air cathode 214, and the gap 216. The metallic anode 212 may include any of various different materials suitable for generating electricity upon exposure to the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. For the sake of clarity of explanation, the metallic anode 212 may be described herein as being formed of aluminum such that the metal-air battery 210 is an Al-air battery that can, in certain implementations, produce electricity according to Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 above. Unless otherwise specified or made clear from the context, however, it should be appreciated that the metallic anode 212 may further, or instead, include any one or more other materials, including materials participating in primary reactions on the surface of the metallic anode 212 and ancillary materials present, for example, for supporting the metallic anode 212. Examples of other materials include zinc, germanium, calcium, iron, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, silicon, tin, and combinations thereof. In certain implementations, the metallic anode 212 includes pure metal. In some implementations, the metallic anode 212 includes an alloy of a metal. The metallic anode 212 may be wholly disposed within the housing 218, where the metallic anode 212 is generally protected from an external environment. The air cathode 214 may allow air or another oxygen containing fluid, substance, or solution into the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210 for reacting with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. The combination of oxygen and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may react with the metallic anode 212 to produce electricity , as indicated in Eq. 1 and 2 with respect to the reaction with aluminum. It should be appreciated that, in certain implementations, a seawater-breathing cathode may be used in addition to, or instead of, the air cathode 214 without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In certain implementations, the air cathode 214 may include a reactive layer of carbon having one or more of a nickel-grid current collector, a catalyst , cobalt, and a porous hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE film that may prevent leakage of the electrolyte 232. Continuing with this example, oxygen in the air of the external environment may pass through the PTFE of the air cathode 214, such that the oxygen reacts with water in an aqueous solution of the electrolyte 232 to create hydroxide ions. The hydroxide ions may react with the metallic anode 212 , according to Eqs. 1 and 2 above to yield a waste product , aluminate and electrons that can perform useful work. To facilitate the passage of air through the air cathode 214 from the external environment, the air cathode 214 may be partially disposed within the housing 218. To facilitate escape of a waste product or other gases from the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210, the housing 218 may include a first membrane 220 permeable to hydrogen gas and substantially impermeable to the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. While the first membrane 220 is described as being a single membrane, it should be appreciated that the first membrane 220 may include a plurality of membranes. One or more of the metallic anode 212 and the air cathode 214 may be substantially hydrophilic. For example, the metallic anode 212 may be naturally hydrophilic. Additionally, or alternatively, the air cathode 214 may be configured to be hydrophilic. In certain implementations in which the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 includes an aqueous solution, the hydrophilicity of the metallic anode 212 and the air cathode 214 can facilitate displacing the liquid 234 from the surface of the metallic anode 212 and the air cathode 214 such that the liquid 234 does not foul the surface of, or otherwise degrade performance of, the metallic anode 212 or the air cathode 214. The fluid circuit 230 may be in fluid communication with the metal-air battery 210, and more specifically, with the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210. The fluid circuit 230 may generally include one or more of piping, reservoirs, pumps, and combinations thereof, such that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 and the liquid 234 are movable between the fluid circuit 230 and the gap 216. For example, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 and the liquid 234 can displace one another from each of the fluid circuit 230 and the gap 216 when being moved between the fluid circuit 230 and the gap 216. Further, or instead, the fluid circuit 230 and the gap 216 may define a substantially closed system as different substances , the liquid 234 and a flowable form of the electrolyte 232 are displaced back and forth in the gap 216. It will be understood that a substantially closed system in this context includes a completely closed system , a hermetically sealed system, as well as partially closed systems in which the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 are sealed within the system, but air, hydrogen, or other fluids may enter or leave the system. It will be understood that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may include one or more movable forms of the electrolyte. For example, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may include the electrolyte in a liquid state, a substantially liquid state , a gel, a gaseous state, a powder, a solid state, and combinations thereof. More generally, it should be understood that, as used herein, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 includes any form of electrolyte that can be made to flow through the fluid circuit 230 through the exertion of force and/or through the addition of a fluid, a gel, or other similar carrier. In certain implementations, water or another carrier can be added to the fluid circuit 230 such that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 can flow into the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210 to begin production of electricity in an activated state of the metal-air battery 210. In certain instances, the metal-air battery system 120 may include one or more crystallizers 252 that maintain a predetermined conductivity of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. The flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may include one or more of an aqueous solution of the electrolyte, a gel containing the electrolyte, a powder, crystallized electrolytes, and combinations thereof. The flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be reactive with the metallic anode 212 as described herein, and conductive between the metallic anode 212 and the air cathode 214 as described herein. The flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may include, for example, one or more of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may also, or instead, include one or more of a polymer, an alcohol, an organic substance, an inorganic substance, an ionic substance, and combinations thereof. The liquid 234 may be substantially nonreactive with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232, such that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is less reactive with the liquid 234 than with the metallic anode 212. The liquid 234 being substantially nonreactive with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may also, or instead, include that a majority of the total mass both of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 do not react with one another under normal operating conditions of the metal-air battery 210 , normal operating temperatures and pressures for certain predetermined time periods , a predicted life of the metal-air battery 210, a predicted time span between services of the metal-air battery 210 or an electrical load 202, or a certain number of uses of the metal-air battery 210. In this manner, the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 can be in the fluid circuit 230 without causing adverse chemical reactions within the metal-air battery system 120. For example, both the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be included simultaneously in a single reservoir of the fluid circuit 230, prior to an initial activation of the metal-air battery 120. Additionally, or alternatively, the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may displace one another within one or more of the gap 216 and the fluid circuit 230 without causing adverse chemical reactions within the metal-air battery system 120 or limiting such reactions. Additionally, or alternatively, the metallic anode 212 may be less reactive with the liquid 234 than the metallic anode 212 is with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. In this manner, when the liquid 234 is disposed in the gap 216, fewer chemical reactions may occur between the metallic anode 212 and the liquid 234 as compared to when the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is disposed in the gap 216. Limiting these reactions may assist in mitigating corrosion of the metallic anode 212. The liquid 234 may also, or instead, be less conductive than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. In such instances, when the liquid 234 is disposed in the gap 216, fewer ions travel between the air cathode 214 and the metallic anode 212 as compared to when the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is disposed in the gap 216. Limiting such conductivity may assist in mitigating corrosion of the metallic anode 212 or capacity fade of the metal-air battery 210. The liquid 234 may also, or instead, be substantially immiscible with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. In certain implementations, a majority of the total mass both of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 does not mix with one another under normal operating conditions of the metal-air battery 210 , normal operating temperatures and pressures for certain predetermined time periods , a predicted life of the metal-air battery 210, a predicted time span between services of the metal-air battery 210 or the electrical load 202, or a certain number of uses of the metal-air battery 210. In this manner, the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be in the fluid circuit 230 without mixing, or with limited mixing. For example, both the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be included in a single reservoir of the fluid circuit 230 prior to an initial activation of the metal-air battery 210, where the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 remain substantially separate. Additionally, or alternatively, the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may displace one another within one or more of the gap 216 and the fluid circuit 230 without mixing with one another, or with limited mixing. The liquid 234 may also, or instead, have a different density than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 at room temperature or at another temperature or at other environmental conditions, , pressure suitable for operation of the metal-air battery 210. The liquid 234 having a different density than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232, which may facilitate placement of one or more of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in a predetermined location in the fluid circuit 230 , prior to an initial activation of the metal-air battery 210. By way of example, the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be substantially immiscible with respect to one another, and include different densities, where the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 are each located in the same reservoir prior to an initial activation of the metal-air battery 120. The properties of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may allow for the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 to be disposed in a location of such a reservoir that is separated from the liquid 234 such that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 can travel into the gap 216 upon an initial activation of the metal-air battery 210. The liquid 234 may also, or instead, be substantially inviscid to promote ease of movement of the liquid 234 in the fluid circuit 230. In certain implementations, the liquid 234 may include an oil. By way of example, the liquid 234 may include one or more of a mineral oil and a silicone oil. Such oils may be advantageous, for example, in the metal-air battery system 120 in which the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is an aqueous solution, where the oil and the aqueous solution are substantially immiscible, the oil is less conductive than the aqueous solution, and the oil is less reactive with the metallic anode 212 than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. The liquid 234 may also, or instead, include other oil-like fluids to displace the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the metal-air battery system 120. The liquid 234 may be movable in the fluid circuit 230 to displace the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the fluid circuit 230. Similarly, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be movable in the fluid circuit 230 to displace the liquid 234 in the fluid circuit 230. As stated above, the fluid circuit 230 may include one or more of piping, reservoirs, pumps, and combinations thereof. For example, the fluid circuit 230 may include a first pump 236. The first pump 236 may be actuatable to displace one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the gap 216 with the other one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the fluid circuit 230. For example, the first pump 236 may be actuatable to displace the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the gap 216 with the liquid 234 from the fluid circuit 230, where the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 moves into the fluid circuit 230 from the gap 216 upon displacement by the liquid 234. Similarly, the first pump 236 may be actuatable to displace liquid 234 in the gap 216 with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the fluid circuit 230, where the liquid 234 moves into the fluid circuit 230 from the gap 216 upon displacement of the liquid 234 by the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. Because the first pump 236 may be actuatable to displace liquid 234 in the gap 216 with a flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the fluid circuit 230, the first pump 236 may act as a switch, or may be in electrical communication with a switch or other controller 204, , for controlling electrical and ionic communication of the metallic anode 212 with the air cathode 214 between an activated state and a deactivated state of the metal-air battery 210. For example, the first pump 236 may be actuatable via a controller 204 to displace one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the gap 216 with the other one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 as the controller 204 is moved or otherwise manipulated between an activated state and a deactivated state. In this manner, the controller 204 can be, for example, a switch, or the controller 204 may otherwise include a switch. The fluid circuit 230 may also, or instead, include a first reservoir 238. The first reservoir 238 may hold one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232, while the other one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is disposed in the gap 216. For example, first pump 236 may be actuatable to move one of the liquid 234 and a flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the first reservoir 238 to the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 120, or vice-versa, where movement of one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the first reservoir 238 to the gap 216 displaces the other one of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the gap 216 to the first reservoir 238. The first reservoir 238 may include a second membrane 242 permeable to hydrogen gas and substantially impermeable to the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. The second membrane 242 may allow a waste product or other gases to escape the first reservoir 238, which may facilitate movement of one or more of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 within the fluid circuit 230. The metal-air battery system 120 may, further or instead, include a second reservoir 244. The second reservoir 244 may be disposed, for example, in fluid communication with the first reservoir 238. The second reservoir 244 may include a carrier 246 movable from the second reservoir 244 to the fluid circuit 230, to the metal-air battery 210, or both. For example, in certain implementations, the carrier 246 may be movable from the second reservoir 244 to the first reservoir 238 for mixing with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. The mixture of the carrier 246 and the electrolyte 232 may have a greater flowability than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 alone. For example, the carrier 246 may increase the flowability of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 by decreasing the viscosity of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. The carrier 246 may include a liquid, such as liquid water. Thus, in certain implementations, the mixture of the carrier 246 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may include an aqueous solution of the electrolyte 232. For example, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may include a powder, and the carrier 246 may include water. Continuing with this example, the mixture of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 and the water creates an aqueous solution containing the powder. The carrier 246 may also, or instead, include a gel. The metal-air battery system 120 may include a second pump 248 in fluid communication with the second reservoir 244. In certain implementations, the second pump 248 is disposed between the first reservoir 238 and the second reservoir 244 and the second pump 248 may be actuatable to supply the carrier 246 from the second reservoir 244 to the first reservoir 238. The second reservoir 244 may include a third membrane 250, which can be permeable to a gas , air and substantially impermeable to the carrier 246. The membrane may allow for movement of the carrier 246 from the second reservoir 244 to the fluid circuit 230. One or more of the membranes in the metal-air battery system 120 may be sealable , when the metal-air battery 210 is not in use. Referring now to 1 and 2, the metal-air battery 120 may be in electrical communication with an electrical load 202 associated with the BEV 102. For example, the electrical load 202 may include a load associated with the rechargeable battery 110 or other electrical components of the BEV 102. For example, displacement of the liquid 234 from the gap 216 by the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may start electrical generation in the metal-air battery 210 to recharge the rechargeable battery 110. It will be understood that, while the metal-air battery system 120 shown in 2 shows a single metal-air battery 210, the metal-air battery system 120 may instead include a plurality of metal-air batteries 210 arranged in the form of a multi-cell battery. 3 is a schematic representation of the metal-air battery system 120 in a first state of operation. It will be understood that the various states of operation described herein with reference to 3-8 are provided by way of example and not of limitation. The first state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120 may be a state of operation prior to an initial activation of the metal-air battery 210. As discussed above, the metal-air battery 210 may include a metallic anode 212, an air cathode 214, and a housing 218, where there is a space in the housing 218 between the metallic anode 212 and the air cathode 214 defining a gap 216. The metal-air battery system 120 may further include a fluid circuit 230 in fluid communication with the metal-air battery 210, and more particularly, a fluid circuit 230 in fluid communication with the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210. The fluid circuit 230 may include a first reservoir 238 in fluid communication with the metal-air battery 210, , through a piping system including one or more pipes. The fluid circuit 230 may further include a first pump 236 disposed between the metal-air battery 210 and the first reservoir 238. The metal-air battery system 120 may also include a second reservoir 244 in fluid communication with the first reservoir 238, and a second pump 248 disposed between the first reservoir 238 and the second reservoir 244. In the first state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120, the first reservoir 238 may contain both a flowable form of the electrolyte 232 and a liquid 234. The flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be any as described herein, , including one or more of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. For example, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may include one or more of an aqueous solution of the electrolyte, a gel including the electrolyte, a powder, or a substantially solid mass. The liquid 234 may be any as described herein, , including a liquid 234 having one or more of the following properties: i the liquid 234 may have less reactivity with the metal anode 212 than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 has with the metal anode 212; ii the liquid 234 may be substantially immiscible with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232; and iii the liquid 234 may be less conductive than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. The liquid 234 may also, or instead, have a different density than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 under normal operating conditions of the metal-air battery 210 , normal operating temperatures and pressures. The liquid 234 may include a liquid oil, , one or more of mineral oil and a silicone oil. Because the liquid 234 may be substantially immiscible with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232, and/or have a different density than the flowable form of the electrolyte 232, the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be substantially separated from one another within the first reservoir 238. In the first state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120, the second reservoir 244 may contain a carrier 246 such as any as described herein, , water. Further, in the first state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120, the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210 may be substantially empty, or may otherwise be substantially devoid of any substance or material that can cause substantial reactions with the metallic anode 212, or substantial reactions between the metallic anode 212 and the air cathode 214, where substantial reactions in this context include reactions that could significantly lessen the lifespan of the metal-air battery 210, cause a significant capacity fade, cause significant corrosion, and combinations thereof. 4 is a schematic representation of the metal-air battery system 120 in a second state of operation. The second state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120 may include an initial activation of the metal-air battery 210, or a state in preparation of an initial activation of the metal-air battery 210. In the second state of operation, the second pump 248 may be actuated to move the carrier 246 from the second reservoir 244 as shown by the first arrow 460 in 4 to the first reservoir 238 as shown by the second arrow 462 in 4 for mixing with the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. In certain aspects, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 shown in 4 may have an increased flowability relative to the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 shown in the first state of operation in 3. For example, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the first state of operation shown in 3 may include a crystallized electrolyte, and the carrier 246 may include water, such that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the second state of operation shown in 4 includes an aqueous solution of the electrolyte, , where at least a portion of the crystallized electrolyte is dissolved in the water or is otherwise carried by the water to form the aqueous solution of the electrolyte. In another example, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the first state of operation shown in 3 may include a powder, and the carrier 246 may include a gel, such that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the second state of operation shown in 4 includes a gel containing the powdered electrolyte. Thus, in general, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the first state of operation shown in 3 may include a first viscosity, and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 in the second state of operation shown in 4 may include a second viscosity, where the first viscosity is greater than the second viscosity. In the second state of operation, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 and the liquid 234 may be disposed within the first reservoir 238. The properties of the liquid 234 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may allow for the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 to be disposed in a location of the first reservoir 238 separated from the liquid 234 such that the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 and can travel into the gap 216 upon the metal-air battery 210 being placed in an activated state, such as the state of operation shown in 5. 5 is a schematic representation of the metal-air battery system 120 in a third state of operation. The third state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120 may be a state of operation that places the metal-air battery 210 in an activated state, where the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is moved , pumped from the first reservoir 238 as shown by the first arrow 560 in 5 into the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210 as shown by the second arrow 562 in 5, , using the first pump 236. In certain aspects, the state of operation shown in 5 represents an initial activation of the metal-air battery 210, , where the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is previously predisposed in the first reservoir 238 without any mixing with a carrier 246. In the third state of operation, the first pump 236 may be actuated to move the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the first reservoir 238 into the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210, which may be devoid of another substance prior to such actuation. Alternatively, the gap 216 may contain the liquid 234 prior to such actuation, where movement of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 into the gap 216 displaces the liquid 234 from the gap 216 and into the first reservoir 238. Movement of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 into the gap 216 may cause a reaction to occur between one or more of the metallic anode 212, the air cathode 214, and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232, such that electrical power is generated by the metal-air battery 210. 6 is a schematic representation of the metal-air battery system 120 in a fourth state of operation. The fourth state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120 may be an activated state for the metal-air battery 210, where the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is disposed within the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210 and the liquid 234 is disposed in the first reservoir 238. In the activated state, the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may be maintained in the gap 216 to generate electrical power, , where the air cathode 214 allows for air to enter the gap 216 to cause a reaction with a reactant that travels through the conductive flowable form of the electrolyte 232 to react with the metallic anode 212 thereby generating electrons that can perform useful work. The electrons may be transferred to an electrical load 202. 7 is a schematic representation of the metal-air battery system 120 in a fifth state of operation. The fifth state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120 may be a state of operation that places the metal-air battery 210 in a deactivated state, where the liquid 234 is moved , pumped from the first reservoir 238 as shown by the first arrow 760 in 7 into the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210 as shown by the second arrow 762 in 7, , using the first pump 736. Movement of the liquid 234 into the gap 216 may substantially displace the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the gap 216 as shown by the third arrow 764 in 7. The displaced flowable form of the electrolyte 232 may travel into the first reservoir 238 as shown by the fourth arrow 766 in 7, , taking the place of the liquid 234 that once occupied the first reservoir 238. The substantial displacement of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 from the gap 216 may substantially limit a reactant of a reaction that occurs in the gap 216 in the presence of a higher volume of the flowable form of the electrolyte 232. 8 is a schematic representation of the metal-air battery system 120 in a sixth state of operation. The sixth state of operation for the metal-air battery system 120 may include a deactivated state for the metal-air battery 210, where the liquid 234 is disposed within the gap 216 of the metal-air battery 210 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is disposed in the first reservoir 238. In the deactivated state, the liquid 234 may be maintained in the gap 216 to substantially retard one or more of reactions occurring in the metal-air battery 210, the generation of electrical power by the metal-air battery 210, the corrosion of the metallic anode 212 or another component of the metal-air battery 210, and a capacity fade of the metal-air battery 210. Although shown as separate states of operation, it will be understood that one or more of the states of operation described with reference to 3-8 may be combined, supplemented, or omitted. For example, an initial state of operation for the metal-air battery may include a state where the liquid 234 is disposed in the gap 216 and the flowable form of the electrolyte 232 is disposed in the first reservoir 238 , as shown in 8. By way of another example, the second reservoir 244 may be eliminated from the metal-air battery system 120. Other states of operation are also, or instead, possible. 9 is a flow chart of a method of operating a metal-air battery. The method 900 may include the operation, use, or implementation of one or more of the metal-air batteries described herein, and one or more of the systems described herein. For example, the method 900 may be used to mitigate corrosion in a metal-air battery. As shown in step 902, the method 900 may include supplying a flowable form of an electrolyte from a fluid circuit to a gap defined between a metallic anode and an air cathode of a metal-air battery. The flowable form of the electrolyte may include one or more of sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. The flowable form of the electrolyte may also, or instead, include one or more of an aqueous solution of the electrolyte, a gel including the electrolyte, and a powder. In certain implementations, the metallic anode includes aluminum, , such that the metal-air battery is an aluminum-air battery. It will be understood that other types of batteries may also, or instead, be operated using the method 900. For example, zinc-air batteries , where the metallic anode includes zinc and metal-seawater batteries , where the air cathode is a seawater cathode may be operated using the method 900. As shown in step 904, the method 900 may include maintaining the flowable form of the electrolyte in the gap when the metal-air battery is in an activated state. As described herein, maintaining the flowable form of the electrolyte in the gap may enable predetermined reactions to occur between the metallic anode, the air cathode, and the electrolyte, thereby generating an electrical output from the metal-air battery. As shown in step 906, the method 900 may include, with the flowable form of the electrolyte disposed in the gap between the metallic anode and the air cathode, generating electrical power at the metal-air battery. As shown in step 908, the method 900 may include providing electrical power generated at the metal-air battery to an electrical load, , a lithium-ion battery, where the metal-air battery charges the lithium-ion battery. As shown in step 910, the method 900 may include actuating a pump in fluid communication with the fluid circuit and the gap. The pump may be disposed between the gap and a reservoir holding a liquid. The liquid may be one or more of: i less reactive with the metallic anode than the flowable form of the electrolyte is with the metallic anode; ii substantially immiscible with the flowable form of the electrolyte; and iii less conductive than the flowable form of the electrolyte. The liquid may also, or instead, include a different density than the flowable form of the electrolyte at standard operating conditions for the metal-air battery. The liquid may include a liquid oil, , one or more of mineral oil and a silicone oil. As shown in step 912, the method 900 may include selectively moving the liquid from the fluid circuit into the gap. The movement of the liquid into the gap may displace the flowable form of the electrolyte from the gap to the fluid circuit. Because the liquid may be less reactive with the metallic anode than the flowable form of the electrolyte is with the metallic anode, movement of the liquid into the gap may substantially limit a reactant of a reaction occurring at the metallic anode in the presence of the flowable form of the electrolyte. As shown in step 914, the method 900 may include moving the displaced flowable form of the electrolyte from the gap into a first reservoir included in the fluid circuit. As discussed herein, the movement of one or more of the electrolyte and the fluid from the gap into a first reservoir may occur because of displacement by the other one of the electrolyte and the fluid within the gap. However, the movement of one or more of the electrolyte and the fluid from the gap into a first reservoir may also, or instead, be assisted, , via one or more pumps. As shown in step 916, the method 900 may include maintaining the liquid in the gap when the metal-air battery is in a deactivated state. The liquid being maintained in the gap may substantially limit chemical reactions occurring in the gap, thereby preserving battery life and lessening capacity fade of the metal-air battery. This may be because, as stated herein, the liquid may be less reactive with the metallic anode than the electrolyte. Thus, if the electrolyte is substantially displaced by the liquid in the gap of the metal-air battery in a deactivated state, less chemical reactions may be occurring in the gap, thereby preserving the metallic anode and mitigating corrosion. As shown in step 918, the method 900 may include actuating a pump in fluid communication with the fluid circuit and the gap. The pump may be disposed between the gap and a reservoir holding the flowable form of the electrolyte. For example, as shown in step 914 above, the flowable form of the electrolyte that was displaced from the gap may have been moved into a first reservoir included in the fluid circuit, and the pump may be disposed between the gap and the first reservoir. As shown in step 920, the method 900 may include selectively moving the flowable form of the electrolyte into the gap, , using the pump as discussed in step 918. Movement of the flowable form of the electrolyte into the gap may displace the liquid from the gap to the fluid circuit. As shown in step 922, the method 900 may include moving the liquid that is displaced by the flowable form of the electrolyte from the gap to the first reservoir. Thus, when the flowable form of the electrolyte is selectively moved from the first reservoir into the gap, the movement of the flowable form of the electrolyte into the gap may displace the liquid from the gap to the first reservoir. In certain implementations, at least steps 910-922 of the method 900 may be repeated over the lifespan of a metal-air battery, as the metal-air battery switches between an activated state and a deactivated state. Thus, the method 900 may generally include actuating a pump in fluid communication with the first reservoir and the gap to selectively move one of the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte from the first reservoir into the gap to displace the other one of the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte in the gap, where the other one of the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte received by the first reservoir upon displacement. As shown in step 924, the method 900 may include supplying water to the fluid circuit such that the flowable form of the electrolyte includes an aqueous solution of the electrolyte. Water may be supplied from a second reservoir in fluid communication with the first reservoir, where the first reservoir includes the flowable form of the electrolyte. This step 924 may be an initial step for activating the metal-air battery. By way of example, before activation, the metal-air battery may be in fluid communication with a first reservoir including both the liquid and the flowable form of the electrolyte. Upon activation of the metal-air battery, water may be supplied into the first reservoir thereby creating or adding to an aqueous solution of the electrolyte. The aqueous solution of the electrolyte may then be supplied into the gap of the metal-air battery for generating electrical power through reactions occurring between the metallic anode, the air cathode, and the aqueous solution of the electrolyte. Additionally, or alternatively, supplying water or another carrier or solution to the fluid circuit or the metal-air battery may occur periodically or as-needed to replenish the flowable form of the electrolyte. Similarly, the method 900 may include supplying more of the liquid to the fluid circuit or the metal-air battery to replenish the liquid. An example of operation of a system such as those described herein may include changing the state of a metal-air battery from an activated state to a deactivated state by pumping liquid , oil into the gap of the metal-air battery from one or more locations to displace a flowable form of an electrolyte , an aqueous solution of electrolyte from the gap. This process may take about 30 seconds. The metallic anode of the metal-air battery may include imperfections such as pits or indentations, which may collect electrolytes therein, even when the liquid is moved into the gap. These trapped electrolytes may cause corrosion of the metallic anode. However, because a majority of the electrolyte may be displaced, corrosion of the metallic anode may occur at a fraction of the rate of other corrosion mitigation techniques. In certain implementations, techniques described herein do not leave the metallic anode of a metal-air battery completely dry when the metal-air battery is deactivated. Instead, the fluid that substantially displaces the flowable form of an electrolyte where the fluid may include an oil as described herein may remain in any interelectrode gaps of the metal-air battery. A potential benefit of techniques described herein is that the added mass and volume to a metal-air battery for the displacing liquid may be minimal compared to other mechanical mitigation techniques. This could result in increases to pack-level gravimetric and volumetric energy densities, even over some Li-ion battery packs. Also, while Li-ion battery packs may have relatively high volumetric energy densities for batteries, Al-air battery packs may have a distinct gravimetric energy density advantage, , where a decreased battery weight in an electric vehicle allows for the use of less battery because less mass is to be moved. Moreover, using a lighter battery may result in a lower cost vehicle, which can improve the overall costs of BEVs. Lower BEV cost and the mitigation or elimination of range anxiety using Al-air range extenders could increase BEV market penetration, which can lower greenhouse gas emissions. Techniques described herein may be particularly advantageous for metal-air batteries that are turned on and off in relatively short durations of time. For applications where a metal-air battery is switched on and off in relatively short durations of time, an aqueous solution of electrolyte may be preferred over a gel because of clogging issues that can occur. The above systems, devices, methods, processes, and the like may be realized in hardware, software, or any combination of these suitable for the control, data acquisition, and data processing described herein. This includes realization in one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, embedded microcontrollers, programmable digital signal processors or other programmable devices or processing circuitry, along with internal and/or external memory. This may also, or instead, include one or more application specific integrated circuits, programmable gate arrays, programmable array logic components, or any other device or devices that may be configured to process electronic signals.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "As technological demands increase, demands on separator performance, quality, and manufacture also increase. Various techniques have been developed to improve the performance properties of membranes or porous substrates used as separators in lithium batteries. Applications of polymeric coatings and ceramic-containing polymeric coatings are known methods to improve the thermal safety performance of a microporous battery separator membrane in a lithium battery. Such coatings may be applied as a coating or a layer onto one or both sides of a microporous battery separator membrane in order to promote high-temperature stability, control oxidation at the separator-cathode interface of the microporous battery separator membrane, and improve safety performance of the microporous battery separator membrane in various battery systems, such as lithium ion rechargeable or secondary battery systems. 6,432,586, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses various ceramic-coated separators. Additionally, Patent Publication 2014/0045033, which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses various ceramic particle-containing polymeric coatings for microporous battery separator membranes which may provide improvement in safety, battery cycle life, and high temperature performance. Such coatings may include one or more polymeric binders, one or more types of inorganic ceramic particles and an aqueous solvent, a non-aqueous solvent, or water. Such coatings may be applied using various technologies such as, but not limited to, dip coating, knife, gravure, curtain, spray, etc. Furthermore, various known ceramic particle-containing polymeric coatings may be applied at varying thicknesses, such as a thickness of, for example, 2 to 6 microns onto one or both sides of a microporous battery separator membrane. Increasing performance standards, safety standards, manufacturing demands, and/or environmental concerns make development of new and/or improved coating compositions for battery separators desirable. One major safety issue for lithium-ion batteries is thermal runaway. Abuse conditions, such as overcharge, over-discharge, and internal short-circuits, for example, can lead to battery temperatures far above those which the temperatures that battery manufacturers intended their batteries to be used. Shutdown of the battery, , a stopping of ionic flow across the separator, , between an anode and a cathode in the event of thermal runaway, is a safety mechanism used to prevent thermal runaway. Separators in lithium-ion batteries must offer the ability to shutdown at temperatures at least slightly lower than that at which thermal runaway occurs, while still retaining their mechanical properties. Faster shutdown at lower temperatures and for a longer duration, , so that the user or device has longer time to turn off the system, is very desirable. Another major safety issue for lithium-ion batteries are shorts hard or soft caused when the electrodes contact each other. A hard short may occurs if the electrodes come into direct contact with each other and may also occur when a lot of maybe 100 or very large lithium dendrites, growing from the anode, come into contact with the cathode. The result may be thermal runaway. A soft short may occur when small or a single or a small number, like 5 lithium dendrite growing from the anode comes into contact with the cathode. Soft shorts may reduce the cycling efficiency of the battery. Past ceramic-coated separators are good at preventing hard and soft shorts, but there is a constant desire to improve this function of separators. For example, it is desirable to maintain this function with thinner and thinner coatings. Hence, there is a need for improvements in at least the performance, safety, manufacture, etc. of past coating compositions and coated battery separators.",

In a preferred embodiment, a co-polymer block co-polymer derived from a lactam comprises, in its backbone, a group capable of creating cross-linking between at least two co-polymers or block co-polymers chains. For example, the group may be an epoxide group or an alkyl amine. When the group capable of creating cross-linking between at least two co-polymers or block co-polymers chains is an epoxide, the epoxide undergoes an epoxidation reaction to create the cross-linking. In some embodiments, addition of a catalyst is required. For example, if the group capable of creating cross-linking between at least two co-polymers or block co-polymers chains is an epoxide, catalyst comprising an alkyl amine group may be added, and if the group is an alkyl amine, a catalyst comprising an epoxide group may be added. A co-polymer or block-copolymer described in this paragraph may have a structure as shown in 1, where X is a group capable of creating cross-linking between at least two co-polymers or block co-polymers chains, , an epoxide or alkyl amine-containing group. One embodiment of the co-polymer block co-polymer derived from a lactam described in this paragraph is shown in 1 below:An example of cross-linking between at least two co-polymers or block co-polymers chains created by the co-polymer block co-polymer derived from a lactam in 1 is shown in 2. In 2 the polymer chains are PVP chains so R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 in 1 are hydrogen and Y is 2. Use of a co-polymer or block co-polymer derived from a lactam that comprises, in its backbone, a group capable of creating cross-linking between at least two co-polymers or block co-polymers chain can increase thermal stability, increase electrolyte stability, improve wetting, and CV performance of a resulting coating layer. In another preferred embodiment, the polymeric binder comprises, consists of, or consists essentially of polyvinyl alcohol PVA. Use of PVA may result in a low curl coating layer, which helps the substrate to which is it applied stay stable and flat, , helps prevent the substrate from curling. PVA may be added in combination with any other polymeric, oligomeric, or elastomeric material described herein, particularly if low curling is desired. In another preferred embodiment, the polymeric binder may comprise, consist of, or consists essentially of an acrylic resin. The type of acrylic resin is not particularly limited, and may be any acrylic resin that would not be contrary to the goals stated herein, , providing a new and improved coating composition that may, for example, be used to make battery separators having improved safety. For example, the acrylic resin may be at least one, or two, or three, or four selected from the group consisting of polyacrylic acid PAA, polymethylmethacrylate PMMA, polyacrylonitrile PAN, polymethyl acrylate PMA. In other preferred embodiments, the polymeric binder may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of carboxymethyl cellulose CMC, an isobutylene polymer, latex, or any combination these. These may be added alone or together with any other suitable oligomeric, polymeric, or elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the polymeric binder may comprise a solvent that is water only, an aqueous or water-based solvent, and/or a non-aqueous solvent. When the solvent is water, in some embodiments, no other solvent is present. The aqueous or water-based solvent may comprise a majority more than 50% water, more than 60% water, more than 70% water, more than 80% water, more than 90% water, more than 95% water, or more than 99%, but less than 100% water. The aqueous or water-based solvent may comprise, in addition to water, a polar or non-polar organic solvent. The non-aqueous solvent is not limited and may be any polar or non-polar organic solvent compatible with the goals expressed in this application. In some embodiments, the polymeric binder comprises only trace amounts of solvent, and in other embodiments it comprises 50% or more solvent, sometimes 60% or more, sometimes 70% or more, sometimes 80% or more, etc. The ratio of heat-resistant particles to polymeric binder in the coating composition is, in some embodiments, 50:50 to 99:1, in other embodiments, it is 70:30 to 99:1 or 90:1 to 98:2, and in further embodiments, it is 90:10 to 99:1. This ratio affects coverage of the heat-resistant particles by the polymeric binder. For example, when the ratio of heat-resistant particles to polymeric binder is lower, there will be more coverage of the heat-resistant particles with binder , as shown on the right in 3, and with the ratio of heat-resistant particles to polymeric binder is higher, there will be less coverage of the heat-resistant particles, , as shown on the left in 3. In a preferred embodiment, at least one of the heat-resistant particles is coated or partially-coated by the polymeric binder. For example, in some embodiments, 0. 01 to 99. 99% of the surface area of at least one of the heat-resistant particles or of the surface area of all of the heat-resistant particles is coated by the binder. In some embodiments, 0. 01 to 99. 99% of the total surface area of the heat-resistant particles in the composition is coated with polymeric binder. 2 Heat-Resistant ParticlesIn another aspect, heat-resistant particles are added to the coating composition described herein. The size, shape, chemical composition, etc. of these heat-resistant particles is not so limited. The heat-resistant particles may comprise an organic material, an inorganic material, , a ceramic material, or a composite material that comprises both an inorganic and an organic material, two or more organic materials, and/or two or more inorganic materials. In some embodiments, heat-resistant means that the material that the particles are made up of, which may include a composite material made up of two or more different materials, does not undergo substantial physical changes, , deformation, at temperatures of 200 C. Exemplary materials include aluminum oxide Al2O3, silicon dioxide SiO2, graphite, etc. Non-limiting examples of inorganic materials that may be used to form the heat-resistant particles disclosed herein are as follows: iron oxides, silicon dioxide SiO2, aluminum oxide Al2O3, boehmite AlOOH, zirconium dioxide ZrO2, titanium dioxide TiO2, barium sulfate BaSO4, barium titanium oxide BaTiO3, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, calcium fluoride, barium fluoride, zeolite, apatite, kaoline, mullite, spinel, olivine, mica, tin dioxide SnO2, indium tin oxide, oxides of transition metals, graphite, carbon, metal, and any combinations thereof.

The heat-resistant particles may be round, irregularly shaped, flakes, etc. The average particle size of the heat-resistant material ranges from 0. 01 to 5 microns, from 0. 03 to 3 microns, from 0. 01 to 2 microns, etc. As described above, in a preferred embodiment, at least one of the heat-resistant particles added to the coating composition described herein is coated or partially-coated by the polymeric binder. In other embodiments, the heat-resistant particles may in addition to or as an alternative to being coated or partially-coated by the polymeric binder be coated or partially coated by a compatibilizer, , a material that makes the particles more miscible with the polymeric binder. Generally, the heat-resistant particles may be coated or uncoated in any way that would not be inconsistent with the stated goals herein. Not wishing to be bound by theory, oxidation or reduction reactions may occur during the formation stage of a lithium ion battery or during charging or discharging of a lithium ion battery, and these reactions may generate byproducts that can harm battery systems. The coating compositions described herein may slow down or may prevent oxidation reactions that could occur for uncoated polypropylene PP or polyethylene PE porous substrates, , battery separators. Heat-resistant particles, , particles comprising aluminum oxide Al2O3, are chemically inert and do not undergo oxidation with an electrolyte. Oxidative stability improvement may be obtained by placing a coated side of the separator described herein facing or against the cathode or positive electrode. 3 Added ComponentsThe coating composition comprises at least one, or two, or three, etc. of a a cross-linker, b a low-temperature shutdown agent, c an adhesion agent, d a thickener, e a friction reducing agent, and f a high-temperature shutdown agent. a Cross-LinkerIn another aspect, at least one cross-linker may be added to the coating composition. The cross-linker is not so limited, and includes any compound capable of forming a connection between two or more polymer chains in the coating composition, so long as the compounds are not otherwise incompatible with the stated goals herein. For example, the cross-linker may be a compound having multiple reactive groups, , epoxy groups, acrylate groups, etc. For example, the cross-linker may comprise two, three, four, five, etc. reactive groups. In some embodiments, a multi-epoxy group cross-linker is preferred. In one preferred embodiment, the cross-linker may be part of, , in the backbone of, the polymeric, oligomeric, or elastomeric material in the polymeric binder. For example, the cross-linker may be the epoxide group of the co-polymer or block co-polymer derived from a lactam as shown in 1. The cross-linker may be added in any amount not inconsistent with the stated goals herein. In some preferred embodiments the amount of cross-linker may be added at a ppm level, , up to 50,000 ppm, up to 10,000 ppm, up to 5,000 ppm, etc. with respect to the total coating composition. When the cross-linker is added, in some embodiment, a cross-linking agent or catalyst can be added, which may initiate or catalyze cross-linking of, for example, two polymer chains, via the added cross-linker. The cross-linking agent may be sensitive to heat, light, or chemical environment , pH, , the cross-linking agent or cross-linker may initiate or catalyze cross-linking of one or more polymer chains in the coating composition in response to heating, irradiation with light, or change in pH. When a cross-linker is added to the coating composition described herein, the inventors of this application have found that the resulting coating and a battery separator comprising said coating on one or two sides thereof exhibit many beneficial properties. These properties include lower MD and TD shrinkage even at higher temperatures, , a temperature of 180 C. A coating with higher thermal stability results when a cross-linker is added to the coating composition described herein. Shrinkage is measured by placing a test sample, , a coated porous substrate, between two sheets of paper which are then clipped together to hold the sample between the papers and suspended in an oven. For the 150 C. for 1 hour testing, a sample is placed in an oven at 150 C. for 1 hour. After the designated heating time in the oven, each sample was removed and taped to a flat counter surface using double side sticky tape to flatten and smooth out the sample for accurate length and width measurement. Shrinkage is measured in the both the Machine direction MD and Transverse direction TD direction perpendicular to the MD direction and is expressed as a % MD shrinkage and % TD shrinkage. For the 180 C. for 10 minutes testing, the sample is placed in an oven at 180 C. for 10 minutes and then tested as described above for the 150 C. for 1 hour testing. For the 180 C. for 20 minutes testing, the sample is placed in an oven at 180 C. for 20 minutes and then tested as described above for the 150 C. for 1 hour testing. Shrinkage may be measured for a one-side coated porous substrate or for a two-side coated porous substrate. b A Low-Temperature Shutdown AgentIn another aspect, a low-temperature shutdown agent is added to the coating compositions described herein. The type of low-temperature agent used is not so limited as long as it is not incompatible with the stated goals herein, , providing a coating composition that can be used to produce safer lithium ion batteries. In some embodiments, the low-temperature shutdown agent has a melting temperature that is lower than that of the porous film on which the coating composition is or is meant to be applied. For example, if the porous film melts around 135 C. , then the low-temperature shutdown agent has a melting temperature that is lower than 135 C. In some embodiments, the low-temperature shutdown agent has a melting point in the range of 80 C. to 130 C. , sometimes in the range of 90 C. to 120 C. , sometimes in the range of 100 C. to 120 C. , etc. The low-temperature shut-down agent may be a particulate having an average particle size ranging from 0. 1 to 5. 0 microns, from 0. 2 to 3:0 microns, from 0. 3 to 1. 0 microns, etc. These particles may be coated, uncoated, or partially coated. In some preferred embodiments, the low-temperature shut down agent may be particles comprising wax, oligomer, polyethylene PE, for example low-density PE, and/or the like. These particles may be coated, uncoated, or partially coated. For example, they may be coated with latex and/or with a polymeric binder as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, these coated low-temperature shutdown agents may be coated with a high-temperature shutdown agent described in greater detail below. The inventors of this application have found that using a coating composition, which comprise a low-temperature shutdown agent as described herein, to coat a battery separator results in a better separator, particularly from a safety standpoint. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that this improved safety results from extending the shutdown window, which is discussed further herein, so that shutdown begins at a lower temperature when compared to the shutdown window of an uncoated separator or a coated separator wherein the coating layer does not comprise a low-temperature shutdown agent. c An Adhesion AgentIn another aspect, an adhesion agent may be added to the coating compositions herein. The compound used as an adhesion agent is not so limited so long as it is not incompatible with the stated goals herein. In some embodiments, adding an adhesion agent to the coatings compositions described herein results in coatings having higher adhesion to battery electrodes, , lithium battery electrodes, comparted to coatings formed from similar coating compositions where the adhesion agent has not been added. The adhesion agent increases the stickiness and/or tack of coatings formed of the coating compositions described herein. Adhesion between the heat-resistant particles in the coating and adhesion of a coating layer formed from the coating compositions described herein to a porous substrate as described herein may also be improved. For example, the coating-to-porous substrate adhesive strength may be greater than 10 N/m, greater than 12 N/m, greater than 14 N/m, greater than 16 N/m, greater than 18 N/m, or greater than 20 N/m, even in embodiments where the porous substrate has not been pre-treated to improve coating layer adhesion. Such pre-treatments may include corona treatment, plasma treatment, stretching, surfactant treatment/coating, and any other surface treatments and/or coatings aimed at improving adhesion of the substrate to a coating layer. However, use of such pre-treatments, though not necessary to achieve excellent adhesive strength between the porous substrate and the coating layer, is not precluded. In some embodiments, the adhesion agent may be polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP or a thermoplastic fluoropolymer such as polyvinylidene difluoride PVdF. One way adhesion of the coating layer to a battery electrode is measured is as follows: A coated battery separator as described herein is place between electrodes, electrolyte is injected into the space between the electrodes, and the electrode-coated separator composite is heat-pressed at 90 C. for 12 hrs. Following this, the composite is disassembled, , the separator is separated from the electrodes, and the separator is observed. If a lot of black material, which is electrode material, is observed on the separator, this indicates a higher adhesion between the separator and the electrode. Lower amounts of black material, or electrode material, indicates lower adhesion. d ThickenerIn another aspect, a thickener may be added to the coating compositions described herein. The thickener used is not so limited and can be any thickener not inconsistent with the goals stated herein. The thickener, in some embodiments, is added to adjust the viscosity of the coating compositions described herein. An exemplary thickener is, for example, carboxymethyl cellulose CMC. e Friction Reducing AgentIn another aspect, a friction reducing agent may be added to the coating compositions described herein. The friction reducing agent is not so limited, and can be any friction reducing agent not inconsistent with the goals stated herein. For example, in some embodiments, the addition of the friction reducing agent can result in a lowering of pin removal force and/or lowering of the coefficient of friction when films formed from a coating composition that contains a friction reducing agent are compared to films formed from a coating compositions where the friction reducing agent is not added. In some embodiments, a coating formed from a coating composition described herein is sticky or adheres well to an electrode when wet, , wet with electrolyte, and has good pin removal when dry. For example, in some embodiments, the pin removal force of films formed from a coating composition that contains the friction reducing agent is less than or equal to 7100 g, in some embodiments, it is less than 6500 g, in some embodiments it is less than 6000 g. In some embodiments the coefficient static ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 8, sometimes 0. 3 to 0. 7, sometimes 0. 4 to 0. 6, and sometimes 0. 3 to 0. 5. The pin removal properties are quantified using the following procedure that measures the pin removal force g. A battery winding machine was used to wind the separator which comprises, consists of, or consists essentially of a porous substrate with a coating layer applied on at least one surface thereof around a pin or core or mandrel. The pin is a two 2 piece cylindrical mandrel with a 0. 16 inch diameter and a smooth exterior surface. Each piece has a semicircular cross section. The separator, discussed below, is taken up on the pin. The initial force tangential on the separator is 0. 5 kgf and thereafter the separator is wound at a rate of ten 10 inches in twenty four 24 seconds. During winding, a tension roller engages the separator being wound on the mandrel. The tension roller comprises a diameter roller located on the side opposite the separator feed, a pneumatic cylinder to which 1 bar of air pressure is applied when engaged, and a rod interconnecting the roller and the cylinder. The separator consists of two 2 30 mm width10 pieces of the membrane being tested. Five 5 of these separators are tested, the results averaged, and the averaged value is reported. Each piece is spliced onto a separator feed roll on the winding machine with a 1 overlap. From the free end of the separator, i. e. , distal the spliced end, ink marks are made at and 7. The mark is aligned with the far side of the pin i. e. , the side adjacent the tension roller, the separator is engaged between the pieces of the pin, and winding is begun with the tension roller engaged. When the 7 mark is about from the jellyroll separator wound on the pin, the separator is cut at that mark, and the free end of the separator is secured to the jellyroll with a piece of adhesive tape 1 wide, overlap. The jellyroll i. e. , pin with separator wound thereon is removed from the winding machine. An acceptable jellyroll has no wrinkles and no telescoping. The jellyroll is placed in a tensile strength tester i. e. , Chatillon Model TCD 500-MS from Chatillon Inc. , Greensboro, N. C. with a load cell 50 lbs0. 02 lb; Chatillon DFGS 50. The strain rate is 2. 5 inches per minute and data from the load cell is recorded at a rate of 100 points per second. The peak force is reported as the pin removal force. COF Coefficient of friction Static is measured according to JIS P 8147 entitled Method for Determining Coefficient of Friction of Paper and Board. In some preferred embodiments, the friction reducing agent is a fatty acid salt. For example, the friction reducing agent may be a metallic stearate such as Li stearate, Ca stearate, etc. Other possible friction reducing agents include siloxanes, silicone resins, fluororesins waxes , paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, low-molecular weight polyethylene, and other hydrocarbon waxes, fatty acid esters , methyl stearate, stearyl stearate, monoglyceride stearate, aliphatic amides , stearamide, palmitamide, methylene bis stearamide, and combinations of any of the afore-mentioned friction reducing agents. f High-Temperature Shutdown AgentAccording to another aspect, a high-temperature shutdown agent is added to the coating compositions described herein. The type of high-temperature agent used is not so limited as long as it is not incompatible with the stated goals herein, , providing a coating composition that can be used in making safer lithium ion batteries. In some embodiments, the high-temperature shutdown agent has a melting temperature that is higher than that of the porous film on which the coating composition is or is meant to be applied. For example, if the porous film melts around 135 C. , then the high-temperature shutdown agent has a melting temperature that is higher than 135 C. In some embodiments, the high-temperature shutdown agent has a melting point in the range of 140 C. to 220 C. , sometimes in the range of 150 C. to 200 C. , sometimes in the range of 160 C. to 190 C. , sometimes in the range of 170 C. to 180 C. , etc. The high-temperature shut-down agent may be a particulate having an average particle size ranging from 0. 1 to 5. 0 microns, from 0. 2 to 3. 0 microns, from 0. 3 to 1. 0 microns, etc. These particles may be coated, uncoated, or partially coated. In some preferred embodiments, the high-temperature shut down agent may be particles comprising polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP or polyvinylidene difluoride PVdF. These particles may be coated, uncoated, or partially coated. For example, they may be coated with latex and/or with a polymeric binder as disclosed herein. In some embodiments, these coated particles are coated with a low-temperature shutdown agent as described hereinabove. The inventors of this application have found that using a coating composition, which comprise a high-temperature shutdown agent as described herein, to coat a battery separator results in a better separator, particularly from a safety standpoint. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that this improved safety results from extending the shutdown window, which is discussed further herein, to a higher temperature compared to the shutdown window of an uncoated separator or a coated separator wherein the coating layer does not comprise a high-temperature shutdown agent. 4 Optionally Added ComponentsIn another aspect, one or more of the following additional components are optionally added: consisting of surfactants, antioxidants, fillers, colorants, stabilizing agents, de-foaming agents, de-bubbling agents, thickeners, emulsifiers, pH buffers, emulsification agents, surfactants, anti-settling agents, levelers, rheology modifiers, and wetting agents. Two or more, three or more, four or more, etc. of these optional additional components may also be added to the coating compositions described herein. SeparatorsIn another aspect, a separator comprising, consisting of, or consisting essentially of a porous substrate and a coating layer formed on at least one surface of the porous substrate is described herein. One-sided coated separators and two-side coated separators according to some embodiments herein are shown in 4. The coating layer may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of, and/or be formed from, any one of the coating compositions described hereinabove. The coating layer may be wet, dry, cross-linked, uncross-linked, etc. The coating may be applied over a PVD layer or a PVD layer may be applied over the coating. The coating may be applied over an adhesive layer or an adhesive layer may be applied over the coating. A new and/or improved separator as described herein may have or exhibit one or more of the following characteristics or improvements: 1 desirable level of porosity as observed by SEMs and as measured; 2 desirable Gurley numbers to show permeability; 3 desirable thickness; 4 a desired level of coalescing of the polymeric binder such that the coating is improved relative to known coatings; 4 desirable properties due to processing of the coated separator, including, but not limited to, how the coating is mixed, how the coating is applied to the substrate, and how the coating is dried on the substrate; 5 improved thermal stability as shown, for example, by desirable behavior in hot tip hole propagation studies; 6 reduced shrinkage when used in a lithium battery, such as a lithium ion battery; 7 improved adhesion between the heat-resistant particles in the coating; 8 improved adhesion between the coating and the substrate; 9 improved adhesion between the coated separator and one or both electrodes of a battery, and/or 10 improved pin removal force and/or coefficient of friction. These objects and other related attributes of an improved coated separator are described in more detail in other parts of this application. The new and/or improved coated separator may have excellent quality and uniformity thus providing good manufacturing yields. The new and/or improved coated separator may provide a battery with improved capacity and improved cycle capability. It may have fewer defects than other known coated separators, for example, fewer gel defects, and/or fewer crater defects. The improved and/or coated separator may have improved coating to porous substrate adhesion. The adhesive strength may be greater than 10 N/m, greater than 12 N/m, greater than 14 N/m, greater than 16 N/m, greater than 18 N/m, or greater than 20 N/m. The new and/or improved coated porous substrate or separator may also have improved safety by exhibiting an extended shutdown window, particularly compared to the shutdown window of the porous substrate itself , the uncoated porous substrate or separator. The extended shutdown window of the new and/or improved separator disclosed herein may extend between about 80 C. to about 200 C. , compared to a window of about 130 C. to 175 C. for the substrate itself. The extended shutdown window of the new and/or improved substrate is also steady, , a constant or relatively constant resistance is measured across the separator over the entire window. For example, in some embodiments, the measured resistance across the separator remains above 10,000 ohms/cm2 over the entire window. This is considered steady. Sometimes, the measured resistance across the separator even goes as high as 100,000 ohms/cm2 over the extended shutdown window of the new and/or improved separator disclosed herein. Initial shutdown of the new and/or improved separator disclosed herein is also quick. Sometimes, during initial shutdown the measured resistance across the separator increases from less than 10 ohms/cm2 to above 10,000 ohms/cm2 as the temperature increases between 1 to 5 degrees Celsius. For example, the resistance might go from being 5 ohms/cm2 at 120 C. to being above 10,000 ohms/cm2 at 125 C. Sometimes a temperature increase of only 4, or 3, or 2, or 1 degree is necessary for this increase in resistance to occur. Preferred thermal shutdown characteristics are lower onset or initiation temperature, faster or more rapid shutdown speed, and a sustained, consistent, longer or extended thermal shutdown window. In a preferred embodiment, the shutdown speed is, at a minimum, 2000 ohms cm2/second or 2000 ohms cm2/degree and the resistance across the separator increases by a minimum of two orders of magnitude at shutdown. One example of shutdown performance is shown in 5. A shutdown window as described herein generally refers to the time/temperature window spanning from initiation or onset of shutdown, , the time/temperature at which the separator first begins to melt enough to close the pores thereof resulting in stopping or slowing of ionic flow, , between an anode and a cathode, and/or increase in resistance across the separator, until a time/temperature at which the separator begins to break down, , decompose, causing ionic flow to resume and/or resistance across the separator to decrease. One example of an extended shutdown window as described herein is shown 6. 6 shows that the shutdown window of a coated porous substrate according to embodiments described herein is extended compared to that of the porous substrate itself, , before coating with one of the coating compositions described herein. The initiation or onset of shutdown occurs at about 135 C. for the uncoated porous substrate and occurs earlier after coating. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, this could result from the addition of the low-temperature shutdown agents described herein to the coating compositions and/or coatings described herein. The low-temperature shutdown agent may melt before the porous substrate, and fill or partially fill its pores, causing an early lower temperature initiation of shutdown. 6 also shows that the duration of shutdown is extended from 170 C. in the uncoated porous substrate to about 190 C. after coating. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, this could result from the addition of a high-temperature shutdown agent as described herein to the coatings and coating compositions described herein. The high-temperature shutdown agent may degrade at a higher temperatures than the porous substrate itself. In some embodiment described herein only the shutdown initiation temperature is lowered extending the window, in other embodiments, only the high-temperature endpoint of the shutdown window is raised extending the window, and in some embodiments both the upper and lower endpoints of the shutdown window are extended, , as shown in 6. Shutdown can be measured using Electrical Resistance testing which measures the electrical resistance of the separator membrane as a function of temperature. Electrical resistance ER is defined as the resistance value in ohm-cm2 of a separator filled with electrolyte. Temperature may be increased during Electrical Resistance ER testing at a rate of 1 to 10 C. per minute. When thermal shutdown occurs in a battery separator membrane, the ER reaches a high level of resistance on the order of approximately 1,000 to 10,000 ohm-cm2. A combination of a lower onset temperature of thermal shutdown and a lengthened shutdown temperature duration increases the sustained window of shutdown. A wider thermal shutdown window can improve battery safety by reducing the potential of a thermal runaway event and the possibility of a fire or an explosion. One exemplary method for measuring the shutdown performance of a separator is as follows: 1 Place a few drops of electrolyte onto a separator to saturate it, and place the separator into the test cell; 2 Make sure that a heated press is below 50 C, and if so, place the test cell between the platens and compress the platens slightly so that only a light pressure is applied to the test cell &lt;50 lbs for a Carver C press; 3 Connect the test cell to an RLC bridge and begin recording temperature and resistance. When a stable baseline is attained, then start ramping the temperature of the heated press at 10 C. /min using the temperature controller; 4 Turn off the heated platens when the maximum temperature is reached or when the separator impedance drops to a low value; and 5 Open the platens and remove the test cell. Allow test cell to cool. Remove separator and dispose of. 1 Porous SubstrateThe porous substrate used in the separator described herein is not so limited, and may be any porous substrate that is not incompatible with the stated goals herein.

In some embodiments, the porous substrate is a single-layer, comprising one or more plies, a bi-layer, where each layer may comprise one or more plies, or multi-layer porous substrate, where each layer may comprise one or more plies. When the porous substrate is a multi-layer porous substrate it may comprise 3 to 10 layers, 4 to 9, 5 to 8, or 6 to 7.

The porous substrate may be made by any one of a wet manufacturing process, a dry manufacturing process, a particle stretch manufacturing process, and a beta-nucleated biaxially-oriented BN-BOPP manufacturing process The porous substrate can be manufactured by, for example, a dry stretch process known as the Celgard dry stretch process of Celgard, LLC of Charlotte, N. C. The porous substrate may be any polyolefin microporous separator membrane available from Celgard, LLC of Charlotte, N. C. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the porous substrate may be manufactured by a wet process, which may involve the use of solvents and/or oils, sometimes known as a phase separation or extraction process, of Celgard Korea, Limited of South Korea, Asahi Kasei of Japan and/or Tonen of Japan. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the porous substrate can be a nonwoven type membrane. A possibly preferred porous substrate may made by a dry-stretch process and have pores of less than 2 um. A microporous substrate, for example, is a thin, pliable, polymeric sheet, foil, or film having a plurality of pores therethrough. Such porous substrates may be used in a wide variety of applications, including, but not limited to, mass transfer membranes, pressure regulators, filtration membranes, medical devices, separators for electrochemical storage devices, membranes for use in fuel cells, and the like. The porous substrate herein is possibly preferably made by the dry-stretch process also known as the CELGARD process. The dry stretch process refers to a process where pore formation results from stretching of the nonporous precursor. See, Kesting, R. , Synthetic Polymeric Membranes, A structural perspective, Second Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, N. Y. , 1985, pages 290-297, incorporated herein by reference. The dry-stretch process is distinguished from the wet process and particle stretch process, as discussed above. In one embodiment, the porous may be a dry-stretched porous substrate having: 1 substantially slit, trapezoidal, or round shape pores, and 2 a ratio of machine direction tensile strength to transverse direction tensile strength in the range of 0. 1 to 20, preferably 0. 5 to 10. Regarding the pore shape, See, 1-5. The round shaped pores of 1-3 differ from the slit shaped pores of 4-5 and Kestin, Ibid. Further, the pore shape of the instant porous substrate may be characterized by an aspect ratio, the ratio of the length to the width of the pore. In one embodiment of the instant porous substrate, the round shape pore aspect ratio ranges from 0. 75 to 1. 25. This is contrasted with the aspect ratio of the slit shaped pore dry-stretched membranes which are greater than 5. 0. Regarding the ratio of machine direction tensile strength to transverse direction tensile strength, in one round shape pore embodiment, this ratio is from 0. 5 to 5. 0. This ratio differs from the corresponding ratio of the slit shape pore membranes which is greater than 10. 0. Machine Direction MD and Transverse Direction TD tensile strength are measured using Instron Model 4201 according to ASTM-882 procedure. The instant porous substrate may be further characterized as follows: an average pore size in the range of 0. 03 to 0. 30 microns m; a porosity in the range of 20-80%; and/or a transverse direction tensile strength of greater than 50, preferably 100, more preferably 250 Kg/cm2. The foregoing values are exemplary values and are not intended to be limiting, and accordingly should be viewed as merely representative of the instant porous substrate. Pore size is measured using the Aquapore available through Porous Materials, Inc. PMI. Pore size is expressed in m. The instant porous substrate is preferably made by a dry-stretch process where a precursor is MD stretched, TD stretched, biaxially stretched i. e. , not only stretched in the MD, but also in the TD direction. This process will be discussed in greater detail below. In general, the process for making the foregoing porous substrate includes the steps of extruding a nonporous precursor, and then MD, TD or biaxially stretching the nonporous precursor. Optionally, the nonporous precursor may be annealed prior to stretching. In one embodiment, the biaxial stretching includes a machine direction stretch and a transverse direction stretch with a simultaneous controlled machine direction relax. The machine direction stretch and the transverse direction stretch may be simultaneous or sequential. In one embodiment, the machine direction stretch is followed by the transverse direction stretch with the simultaneous machine direction relax. This sequential process is discussed in greater detail below. Extrusion is generally conventional conventional refers to conventional for a dry-stretch process. The extruder may have a slot die for flat precursor or an annular die for parison precursor. In the case of the latter, an inflated parison technique may be employed , a blow up ratio BUR. However, the birefringence of the nonporous precursor does not have to be as high as in the conventional dry-stretch process. For example, in the conventional dry-stretch process to produce a porous substrate with a &gt;35% porosity from a polypropylene resin, the birefringence of the precursor would be &gt;0. 0130; while with the instant process, the birefringence of the PP precursor could be as low as 0. 0100. In another example, a porous substrate with a &gt;35% porosity from a polyethylene resin, the birefringence of the precursor would be &gt;0. 0280; while with the instant process, the birefringence of the PE precursor could be as low as 0. 0240. Annealing optional may be carried out, in one embodiment, at temperatures between Tm-80 C. and Tm-10 C. where Tm is the melt temperature of the polymer; and in another embodiment, at temperatures between Tm-50 C. and Tm-15 C. Some materials, , those with high crystallinity after extrusion, such as polybutene, may require no annealing. Machine direction stretch may be conducted as a cold stretch or a hot stretch or both, and as a single step or multiple steps. In one embodiment, cold stretching may be carried out at &lt;Tm-50 C. , and in another embodiment, at &lt;Tm-80 C. In one embodiment, hot stretching may be carried out at &lt;Tm-10 C. In one embodiment, total machine direction stretching may be in the range of 50-500%, and in another embodiment, in the range of 100-300%. During machine direction stretch, the precursor may shrink in the transverse direction conventional. Transverse direction stretching following MD stretching preferably includes a simultaneous controlled machine direction relax. This means that as the precursor is stretched in the transverse direction the precursor is simultaneously allowed to contract i. e. , relax, in a controlled manner, in the machine direction. The transverse direction stretching may be conducted as a cold step, as a hot step, or a combination of both. In one embodiment, total transverse direction stretching may be in the range of 100-1200%, and in another embodiment, in the range of 200-900%. In one embodiment, the controlled machine direction relax may range from 5-80%, and in another embodiment, in the range of 15-65%. In one embodiment, transverse stretching may be carried out in multiple steps. During transverse direction stretching, the precursor may or may not be allowed to shrink in the machine direction. In an embodiment of a multi-step transverse direction stretching, the first transverse direction step may include a transverse stretch with the controlled machine relax, followed by simultaneous transverse and machine direction stretching, and followed by transverse direction relax and no machine direction stretch or relax. Optionally, the precursor, after machine direction and transverse direction stretching may be subjected to a heat setting, additional MD or TD stretching, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the ratio of machine direction MD tensile strength to transverse direction TD tensile strength is between 0. 5 to 10. 0, in some embodiments 0. 5 to 7. 5, in some embodiments it is 0. 5 to 5. 0. Machine Direction MD and Transverse Direction TD tensile strength are measured using Instron Model 4201 according to ASTM-882 procedure. In some embodiments, the porous film has a puncture strength of 400 g/mil or greater. Puncture Strength is measured using Instron Model 4442 based on ASTM D3763. The measurements are made across the width of the microporous membrane , the porous substrate or film and the puncture strength defined as the force required to puncture the test sample2 Coating LayerIn one aspect, the coating layer may be an outermost coating layer of the separator, , it may have no other different coating layers formed thereon, or the coating layer may have at least one other different coating layer formed thereon. For example, in some embodiments, a different polymeric coating layer may be coated over or on top of the coating layer formed on at least one surface of the porous substrate. In some embodiments, that different polymeric coating layer may comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of at least one of polyvinylidene difluoride PVdF or polycarbonate PC. In some embodiments, the coating layer is applied over top of one or more other coating layers that have already been applied to at least one side of the porous substrate. For example, in some embodiments, these layers that have already been applied to a the porous substrate are thin, very thin, or ultra-thin layers of at least one of an inorganic material, an organic material, a conductive material, a semi-conductive material, a non-conductive material, a reactive material, or mixtures thereof.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Owing in part to their relatively high energy densities, light weight, and potential for long lifetimes, metal-ion batteries are used extensively in consumer electronics. In fact, lithium-ion Li-ion batteries, for example, have essentially replaced nickel-cadmium and nickel-metal-hydride batteries in many applications. Despite their increasing commercial prevalence, further development of these batteries is needed, particularly for applications in low- or zero-emission hybrid-electrical or fully-electrical vehicles, energy-efficient cargo ships and locomotives, aerospace, and power grids. Such high-power applications will require electrodes with higher specific capacities than those used in currently existing Li-ion batteries. Sulfur and sulfur-containing compounds have been investigated as a potential source for higher specific capacity electrodes, in addition to offering a number of other advantages, including a high theoretical specific capacity 1672 mAh/g, high energy density, low voltage operation, and relative material abundance. Sulfur's specific capacity is the highest among solid cathode compounds known for rechargeable Li-ion batteries and an order of magnitude greater than currently available commercial cathodes. Its ultra-high specific capacity can enable exceptional gravimetric and volumetric energy densities in rechargeable batteries , 2600 Wh/kg and 2800 Wh/l, respectively, which is around 4-10 times higher than that of current state of the art Li-ion batteries. Electrochemical reactions in Li/S cells occur at relatively low voltage , approximately 30-40% lower than that observed in conventional cathodes, allowing greater flexibility in designing electronic components and minimizing safety risks associated with high voltage cathodes. Sulfur is also found abundantly in nature, low cost, and light weight, in addition to having a relatively low toxicity. For all of these reasons, sulfur-based cathodes are being investigated as a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, performance enhancing component of metal-ion batteries. However, realization of the full potential of sulfur-based cathodes in metal-ion batteries has been hindered by a number of significant challenges, including low electrical conductivity, low ionic conductivity, and the physical instability of conventional sulfur-based cathodes. Sulfur and sulfur-containing compounds are highly electrically insulating. The ionic conductivity of lithium in sulfur and sulfur-compounds is also very small, which typically slows down the overall rate of the electrochemical reactions and leads to low power characteristics in Li/S cells. In addition, sulfur cathodes generate intermediate electrochemical reaction products polysulfides, such as Li2Sn that are highly soluble in conventional organic electrolytes. This leads to sulfur cathode dissolution and re-deposition of electrically-insulating precipitates on the anode surface, preventing full reversibility of the electrochemical reaction. Thus, despite the theoretical advantages of sulfur-based cathodes, practical application in metal-ion batteries is difficult to achieve. Several approaches have been developed to overcome these difficulties, but none have been fully successful in overcoming all of them. For example, some conventional designs have attempted to address the low electrical conductivity by using a conductive carbon additive to form CS composites, but this does not address the ionic conductivity or cathode instability. Other conventional designs have attempted to address the ionic conductivity by using special electrolytes that cause the sulfur to swell, but this often increases the rate of sulfur dissolution. Still other conventional designs have attempted to improve electrochemical reversibility by eliminating or preventing polysulfide anion precipitation on the anode surface , via electrolyte additives to dissolve insulating sulfur-containing precipitates, but this does not address the more critical problem of sulfur cathode dissolution, or low electrical and ionic conductivity. One of the more advanced approaches for sulfur cathode stabilization involves the formation of porous SC composites by forming a porous carbon matrix and partially filling it with sulfur via melt or solution infiltration. This approach, however, still suffers from low volumetric capacity of the produced composites and still has an unsatisfactorily high cathode dissolution rate. Accordingly, conventional approaches to address sulfur-based cathode shortcomings have found only limited success. There remains a need for better ways to address the low electrical and ionic conductivity as well as physical instability of sulfur-based cathodes in metal-ion batteries.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing improved battery components, improved batteries made therefrom, and methods of making and using the same. A battery cathode composition is provided comprising core-shell composites. Each of the composites may comprise a sulfur-based core and a multi-functional shell. The sulfur-based core is provided to electrochemically react with metal ions during battery operation to store the metal ions in the form of a corresponding metal-sulfide during discharging of the battery and to release the metal ions from the corresponding metal-sulfide during charging of the battery. The multi-functional shell at least partially encases the sulfur-based core and is formed from a material that is i substantially permeable to the metal ions of the corresponding metal-sulfide and ii substantially impermeable to electrolyte solvent molecules and metal polysulfides.

In addition, at least a portion of the composites may be formed with external open channel pores, external to the shell in relation to the core, that extend from an outer edge of the composite towards the core. The open channel pores provide channels for faster diffusion of the metal ions from outside of the composite into the core by reducing the average diffusion distance of the metal ions within the composite. In some designs, at least a portion of the composites may have electrically interconnected sulfur-based cores. That is, at least one layer of their corresponding shells may only partially encase the interconnected sulfur-based cores, rather than fully encase them. In this way, the electrical interconnectivity may be maintained between the individual sulfur-based cores while the at least one layer substantially conformally covers a majority of the interconnected cores. In some designs, the sulfur-based core may comprise pores mixed in with the sulfur material. In other designs, the sulfur-based core may comprise a dense metal-sulfide, which may in some cases comprise individual nano-sized or micro-sized grains of metal-sulfide linked together with a metal-ion-conductive material.

In some designs, the material from which the multi-functional shell is formed may comprise a composite coating of two or more of these materials. The composite coating materials may be arranged in an interpenetrating configuration such that at least two of the composite coating materials contact the sulfur-based core, or alternatively, in a layered configuration such that at least one of the composite coating materials does not contact the sulfur-based core. In addition, the material from which the multi-functional shell is formed may comprise at least one material selected to electrochemically react with the metal ions during battery operation to store the metal ions in the shell during discharging of the battery and to release the metal ions from the shell during charging of the battery. A battery cathode composition of the type described herein may be incorporated into a battery, with the material from which the shell is formed remaining i substantially permeable to the metal ions of the corresponding metal-sulfide and ii substantially impermeable to electrolyte solvent molecules and metal polysulfides during battery operation , over a substantial number of cycles. A method of producing a battery cathode composition is also provided. The method may comprise, for example, forming a sulfur-based core and at least partially encasing the sulfur-based core with a multi-functional shell to form core-shell composites. The sulfur core is provided to electrochemically react with metal ions during battery operation, whereby the electrochemical reaction stores the metal ions in the form of a corresponding metal-sulfide during discharging of the battery and releases the metal ions from the corresponding metal-sulfide during charging of the battery. The shell may be formed from a material that is i substantially permeable to the metal ions of the corresponding metal-sulfide and ii substantially impermeable to electrolyte solvent molecules and metal polysulfides. According to various embodiments, certain methods may further comprise dispersing core-shell composites in a binder solution, applying the dispersion of core-shell composites to a conductive metal substrate, and air or vacuum drying the metal substrate to yield a substantially uniform coating of core-shell composites bonded with a binder on the metal substrate. Other methods may further comprise dispersing core particles in a binder solution, applying the dispersion of core composites to a conductive metal substrate, air or vacuum drying the metal substrate to yield a substantially uniform coating of core particles bonded with a binder on the metal substrate, and depositing the multi-functional shell in a substantially conformal coating to at least partially encase the sulfur-based cores and form the core-shell composites. The at least partially encasing may comprise depositing the multi-functional shell by a vapor deposition method, such as chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, or thermal decomposition of precursor molecules in a gas phase.",

                    "DESCRIPTION": "Aspects of the present invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. The term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature, advantage, process, or mode of operation, and alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally, well-known elements of the invention may not be described in detail or may be omitted so as not to obscure other, more relevant details. As discussed in the background above, there remains a need in the art for better addressing the low electrical and ionic conductivity as well as physical instability of sulfur-based cathodes in metal-ion batteries. The present disclosure accordingly provides or otherwise facilitates the fabrication and use of improved composite materials comprising sulfur or sulfur-based compounds for metal-ion battery cathodes, improved metal-ion batteries made therefrom, and methods of making and using such components and devices. In this way, a more full realization of the positive attributes of sulfur electrochemistry in metal-ion batteries, improved development of advanced sulfur cathodes, and improved development of advanced metal-ion batteries may be achieved. 1 illustrates an example battery cathode material composition comprising core-shell composites according to one embodiment. As shown, each of the composites 102 comprises a sulfur-based core 104 and a multi-functional shell 106 that at least partially encases the sulfur-based core 104, forming a so-called core-shell structure. The sulfur-based core 104 is provided to electrochemically react with metal ions during battery operation to store the metal ions in the form of a corresponding metal-sulfide during discharging of the battery and to release the metal ions from the corresponding metal-sulfide during charging of the battery. The multi-functional shell 106 is formed from a material that is i substantially permeable to the metal ions of the corresponding metal-sulfide, such as Li, Na, Mg, Al, K, or Ca, and ii substantially impermeable to electrolyte solvent molecules and metal polysulfides. In some designs, the material or a portion thereof from which the multi-functional shell 106 is formed may also be selected to be electrically conductive. In some further designs, the material may be selected to additionally be able to store the metal ions of the corresponding metal-sulfide during discharging or more generally, during metal-ion insertion and release them during charging or more generally, during metal-ion extraction, while remaining impermeable to the solvent molecules and the metal polysulfides. In this case, the multi-functional shell 106 not only protects the sulfur-based core 104 from dissolution, but also stores metal ions itself, thereby increasing the total amount of metal ions that can be stored in an electrode during battery operation. Suitable degrees of permeability and impermeability may be assessed, for example, based on relative average diffusion coefficients diffusivities. For example, it may be desirable that the average diffusivity DM of the metal ions through the multi-functional shell 106 be larger than the average diffusivity Dsolv of the electrolyte solvent molecules by a factor 100, a factor of 1000, or even a factor of 10,000, according to various designs. Similarly, it may be desirable that that the average diffusivity DM of the metal ions through the multi-functional shell 106 be larger than the average diffusivity DMPS of the corresponding metal polysulfides by a factor 100, a factor of 1000, or even a factor of 10,000, according to various designs. A cathode may be formed to take advantage of such core-shell structures by coating a metal substrate 108 , aluminum foil with the composites 102 and a polymer binder not shown from a suspension of such particles in a binder solution. Air or vacuum drying may be used to yield a uniform, dry coating of the polymer-bonded core-shell composites 102 on the surface of the metal substrate 108. Alternatively, the composites 102 can be mixed or decorated or coated with a polymer binder and deposited on the metal substrate 108 without any solvents using a dry powder coating system. In some cases, the coated powder can be compressed calendared to achieve higher packing density. In some cases, the coated powder may be exposed to UV light or heated to induce cross-linking of the polymer. The substrate 108 can then be rolled and incorporated as a cathode in an energy storage device, such as a primary or secondary metal-ion battery , Li-ion, Na-ion, Mg-ion, Al-ion, K-ion, or Ca-ion batteries. As explained in more detail below, this new sulfur-based cathode design has the ability to substantially alleviate the problems of sulfur cathode dissolution, low ionic conductivity, and low electrical conductivity associated with conventional sulfur-based cathodes in metal-ion batteries. Additional improvements in performance and stability may also be achieved by using polymeric binders capable of metal-ion transport but also impermeable to electrolyte solvents. 2 illustrates metal-ion insertion and extraction from a core-shell composite during battery operation. In this design, the sulfur-based core 104 is composed of porous sulfur nanoparticles having a network of pores 202. This porous design allows the sulfur-based core 104 to accommodate metal-ion , Li-ion insertion/extraction while allowing the overall particle size to remain constant and the multi-functional shell 106 to remain intact. Maintaining particle size during battery operation helps minimize the sulfur-based cathode degradation problem. The pores 202 can be interconnected or isolated, as is further illustrated in 2. In addition, the composite's nano-scale size , about 20-2,000 nm in diameter reduces the metal diffusion distance, while its near-spherical shape enables a high electrode packing density, electrode uniformity, and minimal surface area per unit volume for a given particle size to reduce undesirable side reactions. These combined measures offer high cathode capacity, a high degree of active material utilization and material loss prevention, and fast charge/discharge kinetics for the battery. In order to enhance the electrical conductivity within individual composites and in order to enhance the long-term stability of the core, particularly for composites larger than 50 nm, a conductive additive , a conductive carbon of nano-sized dimensions, preferably forming an electrically interconnected carbon network can be additionally incorporated in the sulfur-based core. 3 illustrates several examples of a core-shell internal structure with and without conductive additives. As shown, the conductive additives can be incorporated, for example, as separate nanostructures within the core, such as smaller carbon nanoflakes, graphene segments, short carbon nanotubes, segments or particles of nanoporous carbon , with pores in the range of about 0. 3 to 10 nm, small carbon black particles, carbon onions, fullerenes, dendritic carbon, porous carbon, small carbon nanofibers, etc. , or as a thin coating , disordered but electrically conductive carbon around individual sulfur nanoparticles comprising the porous sulfur core. In particular, structure 310 illustrates a porous sulfur-based core 104 without any conductive additives. Structure 320 illustrates a porous sulfur core 104 with a conductive carbon additive provided as separate nanostructures 302 from the internal nanoparticles. Structure 330 illustrates a porous sulfur core 104 with a conductive additive provided as a coating 304 around individual sulfur nanoparticles. Alternatively, the carbon additive in the core may be in the form of a single porous particle with interconnected pores at least partially filled with sulfur. The carbon additives in the core additionally provide structural reinforcement of the composite structure and assist in maintaining constant dimensions during metal ion transport to/from the core from/to the electrolyte. In some designs, particles or nanostructures other than carbon can provide structural reinforcement of the composite structure and assist in maintaining the constant dimensions during electrode fabrication and/or during metal ion transport to/from the core from/to the electrolyte during the battery operation. In some applications, it may be advantageous to use relatively large diameter composites 102 , about 300 nm to about 20 m. Larger sized composites are easier to handle. However, the metal ion diffusion distances become large. Since the average diffusion time is proportional to a square of the diffusion distance, larger diffusion distances lead to slower metal ion insertion and extraction, and ultimately to poorer power performance of the cathode employing such composites. To enhance the ionic conductivity and power performance of larger composites, in some designs, so-called open or external channel pores may be introduced. 4 illustrates several examples of large composites with open channel pores. As shown, open pores 402 may be introduced into the composite structure to provide ion channels with reduced average diffusion distances from the electrolyte to the center of the core 104. The open channel pores 402 may be introduced into any of the composite structure variants herein. Structure 410, for example, illustrates a composite 102 having internal closed for electrolyte solvent access pores 202 in addition to the external open pores 402, while structure 420, as another example, illustrates a composite 102 having internal closed pores 202 and conductive additives 302 in addition to the external open pores 402. As is further illustrated, the dimensions of the external open channel pores 402 may vary, generally, for example, from about 0. 5-100 nm, or more preferably, from about 1-10 nm. Furthermore, it may be advantageous that the open pores 402 occupy less than about 35% of the overall composite volume, or even less than about 15% of the overall composite volume. As shown, the walls of the open pores 402 may be coated with various multifunctional shells 106, as desired. Turning to the composition of the multi-functional shell 106, the multi-functional shell can be made of, for example, 1 metal-ion-conductive ceramics , oxide based, oxy-fluoride based, fluoride based, phosphate based, iodide based, or different materials comprising a metal oxide or fluoride or phosphate or iodide, 2 metal-ion-conductive polymers, 3 a metal-ion-conductive, electrically-conductive carbon , sp2-bonded carbon, or 4 a semiconductor material such as silicon. It is important that the shell remains largely impermeable to the electrolyte solvent during battery operation i. e. , during battery charge, storage, and discharge and therefore does not produce defects or pores during battery operation. In some designs, the material from which the multi-functional shell 106 is formed may comprise a composite coating of two or more of the above materials, in a number of different arrangements and configurations. In some designs, the multi-functional shell 106 can be a composite of two or more structurally and/or chemically different materials, in which at least one material is permeable by metal ions and forms continuous channels within the shell through which ion transport may take place. 5 illustrates an example multi-functional shell structure composed of multiple layers. Each of the layers 502, 504 may have its own composition. For example, in one design, the shell may be composed of a first layer 502 made of metal-ion-conductive ceramics, surrounded by a second layer 504 of electrically conductive carbon. In another design, the shell may be composed of a first layer 502 made of carbon surrounded by a second layer 504 of an ionically conductive polymer , conductive of Li+ ions in the case of a Li or Li-ion battery. In still other designs, the shell can comprise various layered combinations of metal-ion-conductive ceramics, metal-ion-conductive polymers, carbon, and/or semiconductors. In the illustrated design, the composite coating materials are arranged in a layered configuration such that at least one of the composite coating materials does not contact the sulfur-based core. However, in other multi-material, composite coating designs, the composite coating materials may be arranged in an interpenetrating configuration such that at least two of the composite coating materials contact the sulfur-based core. In some designs, it has been found advantageous for the multi-functional shell 106 to contact 20% or more of the core 104 external surface, and even more advantageous for the multi-functional shell 106 to contact 60% or more of the core 104 external surface. 6 illustrates an example multi-functional shell structure composed of multiple interpenetrating materials. In particular, a partial cross-section of an example composite structure 610 of this type is shown with a multi-functional shell composed of a porous skeleton 602 and a pore filler 604 interpenetrating the porous skeleton 602. The porous skeleton 602 may be configured to provide structural integrity, while the pore filler 604 may fill the pores of the skeleton 602 in such a way so as to suppress the transport of, for example, polysulfides though the multi-functional shell. In some designs, the porous skeleton 602 may comprise electrically conductive carbon, for example, with its pores being completely filled with another material selected for the pore filler 604 that is impermeable to, , lithium sulfides. This interpenetrating structure is particularly attractive when one of the materials has a significantly higher electrical conductivity than the other material, such that the total electrical resistance of the multi-functional shell may be minimized. Similarly, the interpenetrating structure is also particularly attractive when one material has a significantly higher ionic conductivity than the other material, such that the total ionic resistance of the multi-functional shell may be minimized. The filler material 604 may comprise, for example, metal-ion-conductive ceramics , oxide based, oxy-fluoride based, fluoride based, phosphate based, iodide based, or different metals comprising metal oxide or fluoride or phosphate or iodide or metal-ion-conductive polymers. In some cases, the filler material need not be ionically conductive and the ion transport may take place through the skeleton material. While this lack of ionic conductivity of either the filler or skeleton material may be disadvantageous in some applications requiring more rapid ion transport , high-power batteries, the overall ionic conductivity through the composite shell may be sufficient for other applications , low- or moderate-power batteries. One advantage of using a conductive porous skeleton within the multi-functional shell is that the shell may remain electrically conductive despite containing an electrically isolative filler material. Another advantage is better mechanical integrity. Another advantage is the additional flexibility during synthesis of the core-shell sulfur-based composites. For example, in this way the sulfur-based core material can first be infused inside the porous skeleton shell and then the pores in the skeleton can be filled with a metal sulfide-impermeable filler material. Returning to 1, in some applications, it may be advantageous to deposit or produce the multi-functional shell 106 or at least one of the components thereof after depositing the sulfur-based cores 104 on the surface of the metal substrate 108. In this way, at least a portion of the composites 102 can be made to have interconnected sulfur-based cores 104, with their corresponding shells 106 only partially encasing the interconnected sulfur-based cores 104. 7 illustrates an example electrode design with interconnected sulfur-based cores. In this design, because the sulfur-based cores 104 are electrically connected when deposited on the surface of the metal substrate 108, the subsequent deposition of an electrically insulating material as the shell 106 or an electrically insulating component of the shell 106 does not reduce the electrical connectivity between the individual composites 102. Good electrical connectivity of the composites within the electrode is important for their application in high-power batteries, for example. In addition to the porous designs discussed above, the sulfur-based core may alternatively be composed, for example, of a fully encapsulated, densely packed metal-sulfide MxS. Denser metal-sulfide cores may be advantageous in certain applications for a number of reasons. They have higher density, which leads to higher volumetric capacity and energy density. The pores shown in 2-4, for example, may be of insufficient volume, which may lead to the breakage of the composites or the multi-functional shell during metal ion insertion. Alternatively, the pores may be of too high volume, which will reduce the volumetric performance of the composites. Metal sulfides have better mechanical strength than porous sulfur, which is important during electrode fabrication since the breakage of the core-containing particles is highly undesired and may lead to inferior properties and inferior stability of the battery electrodes. Metal sulfides additionally exhibit higher temperature stability than sulfur. Similar to sulfur, metal sulfides provide for the formation of composites that are stable in organic or ionic liquid IL electrolytes. But in contrast to sulfur, metal sulfides can be used together with metal-free anodes, such as Li-free graphite anodes for Li batteries or anodes comprising materials which form electrochemical alloys with Li , Si, Sn, Ge, Mg, and others for Li batteries. Composite volume changes may accordingly be reduced during battery operation i. e. , metal-ion insertion/extraction, since the composites begin with metal incorporated into the sulfur-based core. Since the formation of pores is no longer needed within the core, these designs are also simpler to manufacture. The use of metal-sulfides allows production of high quality, structurally stable, more precisely tuned multi-functional shells at higher temperatures. For comparison, the melting point for sulfur is approximately 113 C. while the melting point for Li2S is approximately 938 C. High temperature chemical vapor deposition CVD, sol-gel, and annealing techniques, for example, can be used to optimize ion transport through the shell, electrical conductivity of the shell, and other physical, chemical, or mechanical properties of the shell. 8A-8B illustrate several example designs in which the sulfur-based core is composed of a dense metal-sulfide, both with and without conductive additives, and with and without external open channel pores. In particular, structure 810 illustrates a dense metal-sulfide as the core 104 without any conductive additives. Structure 820 illustrates a metal-sulfide as the core 104 with a conductive carbon additive provided as separate nanostructures 302 from the sulfur nanoparticles 102, similar to structure 320 discussed above with reference to 3. As discussed above, such conductive additives can be incorporated, for example, as separate nanostructures within the core in a variety of ways, such as using smaller carbon nanoflakes, graphene segments, short carbon nanotubes, carbon onions, fullerene, multi-layered graphene segments, graphite ribbons, small carbon black particles, small carbon nanofibers, etc. In some designs it may be advantageous to have electrically interconnected conductive carbon additives to enhance the electron transport rate within the core. In structure 830, the metal-sulfide core comprises individual nano-sized or micro-sized grains 804 of metal-sulfide linked together with a metal-ion-conductive material 806. The metal-ion-conductive material 806 may also be electrically conductive in some designs. The structure 840 is of a larger diameter design , with a diameter in the range of about 200 nm to 20 m and contains open channel pores 402 , sized in the range of about 0. 5 to 100 nm, preferably in the range of about 1 to 10 nm. As discussed above, the open channel pores 402 reduce the average ion diffusion distance. The structure 850 is similar to the structure 840, but additionally contains conductive additives 302 within the metal sulfide core. It will be appreciated that the metal-sulfide core designs can be formed with any of the shell structures or core interconnectivities described herein, as desired. In still other designs, the carbon additive in the core may be in the form of a single porous particle with interconnected pores at least partially filled with sulfur. As discussed above, the carbon additives in the core additionally provide structural reinforcement of the composite structure and assist in maintaining constant dimensions during metal ion transport to/from the core from/to the electrolyte. In some designs, particles or nanostructures other than carbon can provide structural reinforcement of the composite structure and assist in maintaining the constant dimensions during electrode fabrication and/or during metal ion transport to/from the core from/to the electrolyte during the battery operation. According to various embodiments, the core-shell composites can be fabricated in different architectural forms, including, for example, a core-shell powder in which the composites are near-spherical or core-shell flakes or nanoflakes or aggregates thereof in which the composites have a more planar morphology. 1 shows one design in which the composites 102, in the illustrated example, are formed with a substantially spherical, nanopowder morphology of the core and shell. However, other designs and morphologies may be advantageous in certain applications. 9 illustrates other designs in which the composites are formed with a substantially planar, flake morphology of the core and shell. As shown, core-shell flakes with both porous sulfur and dense metal-sulfide cores can be formed in this way. In particular, structure 910 illustrates a porous sulfur material as the core 104 while structure 920 illustrates a dense metal-sulfide material as the core 104. In either case, the sulfur core 104 may be constructed around a 2D backbone 902 , multi-layer graphene to provide the substantially planar, flake morphology. As discussed above, the porous sulfur or metal-sulfide core accommodates metal insertion/extraction, allowing overall composite size to remain constant and the multi-functional shell 106 to remain intact. The further illustrated structure 930 shows an example sulfide core 104 with a conductive additive 302. As with the nanopowder designs above, conductive additives can be added to the core in the form of smaller carbon nanoflakes, graphene segments, short carbon nanotubes, small carbon black particles, small carbon nanofibers, activated carbon, microporous carbon, mesoporous carbon, etc. It will be further appreciated that the flake designs can be formed with any of the shell structures or core interconnectivities described herein, as desired. The planar morphology provides several key advantages in terms of power capabilities. Planar particles offer higher electrical conductivity due to larger area contacts and the ability to propagate all the way from the current collector to the surface of the electrode. The higher surface area per unit volume of the planar particles reduces the thickness of the sulfur-based core, which helps to mitigate sulfur's low electrical and ionic conductivities. Particle swelling during metal insertion/extraction due to insufficient porosity and other defects of the sulfur-containing core can also be accommodated. The presence of the planar backbone 902 helps preserve the integrity of the top and bottom surface area of the multi-functional shell 106, limits shell damage to the small fraction of surface area at the edges of the flake particle, and thus minimizes exposure to electrolyte solvent. 10 illustrates an example three-dimensional agglomerate structure formed from substantially planar, flake morphology composites. In this example, the three-dimensional agglomerate structure 1010 includes a plurality of flake composites 1002 with pores or voids 1004 therebetween, and is shaped as a generally spherical granule. It will be appreciated, however, that other shapes may be created as desired for a particular application, such as an ellipse, an ellipsoid, a rod, or other shapes. It will further be appreciated that while terms like spherical and ellipsoidal, for example, are used to describe the shape of such a three-dimensional structure, these terms are not intended to convey or in any way require that the agglomerates take on a mathematically precise geometric figure. These terms are only used to convey the general shape for illustration purposes. It will be appreciated that, in practice, the three-dimensional agglomerate structure 1010, for example, may simply be substantially round, and not precisely spherical or even ellipsoidal. Various methods can be used to form the sulfur-based core and the multi-functional shell, examples of which are described in detail below. In these examples, it will be appreciated that care should be taken to ensure compatibility between the particles to be coated and the protective coating, as well as the deposition process used i. e. , the coating synthesis conditions should not destroy the particles due to temperature, chemical dissolution, . 11 is a flow diagram of an example method of producing a battery cathode composition according to various embodiments herein. As shown a sulfur-based core is formed for electrochemically reacting with metal ions during battery operation block 1110. As discussed above, the electrochemical reaction stores the metal ions in the form of a corresponding metal-sulfide during discharging of the battery and releases the metal ions from the corresponding metal-sulfide during charging of the battery. The sulfur-based core is then at least partially encased with a multi-functional shell to form core-shell composites block 1120. The shell is formed from a material that is i substantially permeable to the metal ions of the corresponding metal-sulfide and ii substantially impermeable to electrolyte solvent molecules and metal polysulfides. At the appropriate time, the resultant battery cathode composition may be formed into a cathode. This may be achieved, for example, by dispersing the core-shell composites in a solvent mixed with a dissolved polymer binder and optional conductive carbon additives optional block 1130. The suspension of core-shell composites in the polymer binder solution may then be applied to a conductive metal substrate optional block 1140. Subsequently, air or vacuum drying the metal substrate may be used to yield a substantially uniform coating of core-shell composites on the metal substrate, bonded , glued together with a polymer optional block 1150, thereby creating a battery cathode. Alternatively, the blocks 1130, 1140, and 1150 may be replaced by a dry particle deposition method to yield a substantially uniform coating of core-shell composites mixed with optional conductive additives and bonded with a polymer binder on the metal substrate. Finally, the packing density of the produced electrode can be increased by a process called calendaring or pressure-rolling optional block 1160. The above steps, procedures, and techniques may be practiced and supplemented in a variety of ways to achieve the various structures described herein. In a first example, a method of forming a porous sulfur core, with or without conductive additives, using a disproportionation of thiosulfate solution will be described. Here, the synthesis of sulfur powder and nanopowder suspensions may be achieved by disproportionation of a water-based sodium thiosulfate solution Na2S2O3, as is known in the art. According to this process, concentrated HCl is added to a water solution of Na2S2O3 to produce a yellow suspension of sulfur particles sulfur sol. Other precursors can be added to the stable suspension of sulfur nanopowder to later induce uniform metal oxide or carbon coatings on their surface. In order to produce sulfur nanoparticles of the desired morphology and size as described herein including a porous sulfur core in this example, the growth of the primary sulfur nanoparticles may be restricted , to below about 5-10 nm and their agglomeration induced to form porous granules of about 20-600 nm in diameter for spherical particles, or to form thin layers of less than about 2-200 nm in thickness on each side of a planar backbone substrate for planar particles. In the case of planar particle geometry, sulfur nanoparticles or a continuous sulfur layer may be nucleated on the surface of the planar backbone , functionalized graphene, or sulfur nanoparticles may be attached to the backbone surface. In the latter case, the carbon backbone and the sulfur nanoparticles should have opposite charges on their surface. The desired size and porosity of the sulfur-containing core can be optimally tuned by adjusting the concentration of the thiosulfate solution, adding surfactants, adjusting pH of the solution and using acids other than HCl, or varying the temperature during synthesis. Introduction of functionalized conductive additives , carbon into the solution allows formation of a porous composite composed of sulfur and conductive additives. Incorporation of organics , polysaccharides into the solution during wet chemistry synthesis of sulfur nanoparticles creates a carbon-containing organic layer, which can then be transformed into a conductive carbon layer on the outer surface of the entire sulfur core or on the surface of individual sulfur nanoparticles making up the porous sulfur core. Surfactants can be used to create a desired electrical charge on the surface of individual sulfur nanoparticles or agglomerates to facilitate coating with other electrically charged materials. For example, surfactants can be used to induce a positive charge on the surface of sulfur nanoparticles or agglomerates intended to be additionally coated with a polymer having negatively charged surface functional groups , polysaccharides. Subsequent exposure of the mix to elevated temperature, elevated pressure, or to a more acidic environment leads to partial decomposition of the polymer layer, forming a conductive carbon coating on the sulfur surface. In a second example, a method of forming a porous sulfur core, with or without conductive additives, via miniemulsion will be described. Miniemulsion refers to nano-sized , about 20-600 nm emulsion, prepared by emulsification of two immiscible liquids in the presence of surfactants and a third agent with low solubility in one of the liquids often called a hydrophobe. For the preparation of sulfur nanoparticles, sulfur is converted to the liquid phase by mixing the sulfur with water, surfactant, and hydrophobe, and heating the mixture in a pressurized reactor to above the sulfur-melting temperature. The liquid phase sulfur may then be incorporated into a miniemulsion with water using ultrasound or high rate mixing. Once a stable emulsion is achieved, the mixture is cooled down to ambient temperature, yielding a suspension of sulfur nanoparticles in water. Other conductive nanoparticles can be added to the miniemulsion to form sulfur nanocomposites. Subsequently, the porous sulfur core may be formed from the sulfur nanoparticles and nanocomposites using controlled flocculation. In a third example, a method of forming a dense metal-sulfide core, with or without conductive additives, via wet chemistry techniques will be described. For simplicity, the following description relates to the synthesis of lithium sulfide-based structures i. e. , when M=Li. However, it will be appreciated that when M=Na, Mg, Al, K, or Ca, similar approaches can be utilized. To prepare metal-sulfide nanoparticles or other nanostructures using a wet chemistry approach, the metal-sulfide is first dissolved in water, ethanol, or another appropriate solvent. A non-solvent for Li2S that is miscible with water , acetone, is added to precipitate Li2S from the solution. After precipitation, isolation of Li2S nanoparticles may be achieved by centrifugation of the suspension and vacuum drying of the solvent residuals. To prepare Li2S nanoparticles with conductive additives, the desired additives can be suspended in the Li2S solution. Upon non-solvent addition, suspended conductive additives serve as nucleation centers for Li2S precipitation, yielding nanoparticles consisting of metal-sulfide with conductive additives enclosed inside. The size, size distribution, and morphology of precipitated particles can be varied by the non-solvent used, rate of non-solvent addition, application of shear forces to the solution via mechanical mixing or ultrasound, addition of surfactants, and concentration of the initial Li2S in a water solution. In a fourth example, a method of forming a dense metal-sulfide core, with or without conductive additives, via gas phase synthesis will be described. For simplicity, the following description relates to the synthesis of lithium sulfide-based structures i. e. , when M=Li. However, it will be appreciated that when M=Na, Mg, Al, K, or Ca, similar approaches can be utilized. To prepare Li2S nanoparticles using gas phase synthesis, a water solution of Li2S with or without conductive additives may be spray-dried in air. The size, size distribution, and morphology of the final nanoparticles can be controlled by varying the degree of solution atomization during spray drying, the drying temperature, and the relative concentration of components in the solution. Synthesis of dendritic Li2S nanoparticles can be achieved by first emulsifying a water solution of Li2S in oil phase , hexane, toluene, , with surfactants non-ionic, cationic, or anionic added for stabilization. The emulsion is then diffused through oil phase to evaporate the water and form dendrite Li2S nanoparticles. Size and morphology of the nanoparticles can be controlled by varying the initial concentration of the Li2S solution, the nature and amount of surfactant, the relative ratio of water and oil in the mixture, and rate of water evaporation from the emulsion. In a fifth example, a method of forming a metal oxide protective coating as part of a multi-functional shell via low temperature atomic layer deposition ALD for sulfur-containing particles will be described. In ALD, a chemical reaction proceeds on the surface of the sulfur-containing particles to form one shell layer at a time. For each layer, one gas precursor is introduced and chemisorbed on the surface of the sulfur-containing particles. The excess gas is flushed away and another precursor gas is introduced to react with the first chemisorbed layer, creating an additional monolayer of deposited film. Since the ALD process can be performed at very low temperatures, post-treatments , annealing of produced electrodes can be used for additional control over the produced oxide microstructure. An example process flow for the formation of a Li-ion conductive V2O5 layer by ALD may include: 2VCl4g+5H2O adsorbed vaporV2O5s+8HCl g+H2g, or 2VOC3H73g+3H2OV2O5s+6HOC3H7g. Temperature, cycle time, and gas flow rate parameters can be tuned to improve the efficiency of the deposition conditions. In a sixth example, a method of forming a metal oxide protective coating as part of a multi-functional shell via high temperature chemical vapor deposition CVD for metal-sulfide containing particles will be described. Deposition of oxides on any substrate can be challenging if reactive metals , Li are used, because most organometallic precursors are very air- and moisture-sensitive, pyrophoric, and therefore must be handled with extreme care. In addition, due to limited shelf life span, precursors should be freshly synthesized prior to usage. An example process flow for the formation of a Li-ion conductive aluminum oxide layer by CVD may include thermal decomposition of Al tri-isopropoxide at above around 220 C. : 2C9H11O3Al vaporAl2O3solid+6 C3H7g+C3H7O3g. The organometallic precursor such as Al tri-isopropoxide vapors can be carried to the reaction site by a carrier gas, such as argon Ar, helium He or even nitrogen N2. Temperature and gas flow rate parameters can be tuned to improve the efficiency of the deposition conditions. The use of plasma enhancements for CVD or ALD processes may be advantageous in some applications. For example, plasma enhancements may allow the deposition temperature to be reduced while improving the coating microstructure and uniformity. Due to the low evaporation temperature of sulfur, plasma-enhanced PE PECVD and PEALD processes may allow formation of ceramic coatings shells at temperatures where the vapor pressure of sulfur-based core particles is sufficiently small, such as at 100 C. or even at room temperature. The materials and deposition process used should accordingly be carefully selected. For example, the most promising organometallic precursors for ALD and CVD deposition processes should be identified , those that decompose at sufficiently low temperature, provide constant vapor pressure, and produce the highest coating quality at lowest cost from among the many types of commercially available organometallic precursors. Lithium precursors include Li -diketonates freshly synthesized and sublimed, Alky-Li such as tert-ButylLithium, stripped from a solvent, and Lithium alcoholates such as Li-Ethanolate or Li-hexafluoroisopropoxide, freshly synthesized. Common volatile precursors for Mn and other metals, such as V, Co, Ni, Al, include -diketonates or alcoholates. These precursors have been successfully used for CVD of high temperature super conductors and fuel cell materials. Different gases can be used for the deposition process, including dry oxygen O2 as a reaction gas, and argon Ar, helium He or even nitrogen N2 as a carrier gas. Both hot-wall and cold-wall reactors can be used, with separate heated or cooled vaporizers to control the stoichiometry of the obtained film. Liquid delivery and/or flash vaporizers can further facilitate precursor handling and the overall deposition process. Finally, deposition conditions should be selected in such a way that reactions producing metal oxides including lithium-containing metal oxides primarily occur on the surface of the metal-sulfide containing nanoparticles. In a seventh example, a method of forming a metal oxide protective coating as part of a multi-functional shell via electroless deposition and solution precipitation will be described. Metal oxide coatings can be formed via a solution precipitation method. For example, a Mn2+ salt precursor may be added to a stable suspension of sulfur nanoparticles or porous aggregates of sulfur nanoparticles. Over time, Mn2+ cations are adsorbed on the sulfur surface, forming heterogeneous nucleation sites for MnO2 shell growth. Permanganate MnO4 may then be added to oxidize the Mn2+ and produce a MnO2 coating on the sulfur surface. A high concentration of nucleation sites should be achieved prior to adding permanganate MnO4 to produce a conformal, defect-free MnO2 coating. Due to the solubility of metal-sulfides , lithium sulfide in water, methods that use water as a solvent or as a processing gas should be restricted to deposit oxide coatings on the surface of sulfur. In an eighth example, a method of forming a metal oxide protective coating as part of a multi-functional shell via electrochemical deposition will be described. Powders and thin films of metal oxide materials can be prepared by cathodic electrosynthesis from metal salt solutions. In this method, metal ions or complexes are hydrolyzed by an electrogenerated base to form oxide or hydroxide deposits which can be converted to corresponding oxides by thermal treatment on cathodic substrates. Electrosynthesis of an organic phase and electrophoretic deposition of charged polymers may then be used for coating formation. In a ninth example, a method of forming a carbon coating as part of a multi-functional shell via low temperature solution based processes will be described. The carbon coating can be formed on the surface of the sulfur-/metal-sulfide-containing core, or on the surface of other coatings around the core , oxide, oxy-fluoride, fluoride, phosphate, iodide and other coatings. Here, conductive carbon particles such as graphene and sulfur particles or sulfur particles coated with a layer of oxides, fluorides, oxyfluorides, iodides, phosphates, polymers or surfactants may be prepared in such a way as to have opposite charge. For example, graphene can be prepared to have a negative charge on its surface while sulfur or coated sulfur particles can be prepared to have a positive charge on their surface. Mixing the suspension of positively charged sulfur or coated sulfur particles with negatively charged carbon particles induces the formation of a conductive carbon coating around the sulfur or coated sulfur particles. The following is an example process flow for the formation of a carbon coating on the surface of a metal oxide , MnO2 shell pre-deposited on the sulfur-containing core, and in particular, the synthesis of CMnO2S core-shell nanoparticles. In this process, highly flexible and highly conductive graphene layers may be employed. The process begins by preparing negatively charged graphene oxide GO via exfoliation of a natural graphite followed by ultrasonic shearing. While mechanical shearing may produce graphene of very high quality, ultrasonic treatment enables more scalable graphene production with significantly higher yield. Modifying negatively charged OH functional groups on the MnO2 shell surface may then be performed by surface grafting , of aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to facilitate coating by positively charged NH2 groups. Mixing the suspensions of negatively charged graphene oxide particles and positively charged MnO2S particles to induce co-assembling from mutual electrostatic interactions results in the formation of a stable suspension of negatively charged GO-MnO2S particles with an ultra-thin GO coating layer. Subsequent chemical reduction of the GO with hydrazine results in graphene carbon encapsulated MnO2S particles. Centrifugation of the suspension may be used to isolate the produced CMnO2S particles. In a tenth example, a method of forming a carbon coating as part of a multi-functional shell via low temperature hydrothermal decomposition of organics in the presence of catalysts will be described. A method of this type may include the following three steps. First, the addition of a carbon precursor solution , sucrose C12H22O11 to a suspension of sulfur nanoparticles may be performed to induce a sucrose coating of the sulfur nanoparticles. Second, hydrothermal carbonization may be performed via dehydration of the sucrose and subsequent carbonization by the addition of a catalyst , H2SO4. This process can take place at room temperature, but elevated temperatures or pressures through the use of autoclave can dramatically improve process kinetics. Third, centrifugation of the suspension may be performed to isolate the produced CS particles. If metal-sulfide nanoparticles are used instead of sulfur, a water solution should not be used. Instead, a solution that is a non-solvent for metal-sulfides but a solvent for the selected organic molecules should be used. A similar process can be used to coat metal-sulfide , Li2S or coated metal-sulfide or sulfur or coated sulfur particles with a polymer that is subsequently carbonized transformation of a polymer into an electrically conductive carbon layer. For example, metal-sulfide or coated metal-sulfide or sulfur or coated sulfur nanoparticles may be dispersed in an organic solvent, tetrahydrofuran THF, which acts as a non-solvent for Li2S when polycarbonate is the polymer. Polymer is then added and dissolved in the mixture, with the ratio between the metal-sulfide or coated metal-sulfide or sulfur or coated sulfur nanoparticles and polymer measured to control the thickness of the final polymer coating. Polymer non-solvent , ethanol, which is a non-solvent for polycarbonate is slowly added to precipitate the polymer onto the nanoparticles. The polymer-coated nanoparticles may be separated via sedimentation, centrifugation or filtration, and then a carbon shell may be formed by annealing the polymer coated nanoparticles at high temperatures. In order to induce more uniform coverage of the sulfur or coated sulfur, metal-sulfide, coated metal-Sulfide particles with a polymer/organic layer, the particles and the polymer/organic molecules should have the opposite charge. For example, a positively charged surfactant-coated sulfur surface may be used with organic molecules that have a negative charge on their surface , polysaccharides, such as polyacrilic acid PAA. In an eleventh example, a method of forming a carbon coating as part of a multi-functional shell via chemical vapor deposition CVD will be described. This process is more suited to metal-sulfides because it requires temperatures in excess of 350 C. This process involves thermal decomposition of organic precursors: CxH2ygyH2g+xCs. By controlling the precursor flow rate, the degree of precursor dilution in inert gas, the pressure and temperature profile in the deposition chamber, and the nature of the precursor, the mean free path of precursor diffusion into the pores can be controlled before deposition occurs. Under process conditions that limit carbon formation by a surface reaction rate rather than by precursor diffusion, uniform film deposition may be achieved. Doped carbon films can be produced by using a carbon precursor containing elements other than C and H. In some cases, however, the CVD of carbon may not be appropriate. For example, the produced H2 gas may react with a metal sulfide producing hydrogen sulfides. To avoid such reactions, metal sulfide particles may be first coated with a conformal layer of metal oxides, such as aluminum oxide. Such coatings may be deposited by sol-gel, ALD, CVD, or other known methods. In the twelfth example, a method of forming spherical porous carbon-sulfur or carbon-sulfide core composites with a diameter in the range of about 100 nm to 80 microns and pores of about 1-100 nm in size is described. First, a porous carbon scaffold is produced. A mixture of a monomer, optional porogen, and initiator in an organic solvent is dispersed in continuous phase such as water or aqueous solution containing surfactants and polymer stabilizers to form spherical droplets of 200 nm-80 microns in diameter. By changing a dispersion route and optimizing organic solvent/surfactant/monomer/polymer stabilizer combination, the size of the droplets may be tuned to achieve the desired average size. By the action of UV light or heat, near-spherical porous polymer particles may be produced. After oxidation , by treatment in air or oxygen at around 200-300 C. the polymer particles may be further stabilized. By thermal treatment of the produced polymer particles in an inert environment such as Ar or N2 or He or in a mild oxidizing atmosphere such as CO2 spherical porous carbon particles are produced. The porogen content and chemistry in the dispersed phase will impact the size of the large-size pores , about 2-200 nm. An optional activation procedure , by exposing the produced carbon powder samples into the stream of CO2 gas or steam at around 800-1000 C. is then used to increase the pore volume and form smaller pores , about 0. 5-5 nm within the porous carbon particles. Second, the electrically conductive porous carbon scaffold is infiltrated with sulfur or metal sulfides. In one example, sulfur or metal sulfide can be melt-infiltrated into the porous carbon scaffold by immersion of carbon particles into a sulfur or metal sulfide melt. The excess of sulfur or a metal sulfide from the particle surface can be removed by evaporation. The pores within the CS composite core can similarly be formed by partial evaporation of sulfur. Alternatively, sulfur or metal sulfide can be introduced by dissolving it in a solvent, infiltrating the porous carbon scaffold by a sulfur- or sulfide- containing solution and evaporating the solvent. The repetition of this procedure multiple times may allow filling the majority of pores in carbon. In yet another scenario, a non-solvent for sulfur or a metal sulfide such as acetone can be induced into the core of the porous carbon scaffold particles and induce nucleation of sulfur or metal sulfide particles upon the porous carbon scaffold particle emersion into the sulfur or metal sulfide solution. The excess of sulfur or metal sulfide solution can be removed by dipping the particles into a solvent and drying. The repetition of this procedure will similarly allow filling the majority of pores in carbon with sulfur or metal sulfides. Third, the external surfaces of the carbon-sulfur or carbon-sulfide particles are coated with a metal ion permeable but polysulfide impermeable shell. In a thirteenth example, a method of forming a composite carbon-ceramic or carbon-polymer shell is described. First, a porous carbon shell is produced by, for example, formation of a polymer coating and its subsequent decomposition into a porous carbon layer. The use of porogen or activation may allow one to increase the volume of the pore in the carbon shell. Alternatively, evaporation or dissolution of sulfur or metal sulfide from the surface layer of the SCor metal sulfide-carbon composite previously described in the twelfth example above may similarly allow for the formation of a porous carbon shell. Once the porous carbon shell is formed, it can then be infiltrated with a polymer or ceramic filler impermeable to metal sulfide but ideally permeable to metal ions. In the case of a ceramic filler, CVD, ALD, sol-gel, and other methods including the ones previously described may be utilized. 12 shows example electrochemical performance data of an electrode produced according an example embodiment as compared to performance of a conventional electrode. For this example, composites composed of a porous carbon-sulfur core were suspended in an aqueous solution of a polyacrilic acid PAA binder, cast on a metal foil, and dried. After drying, the electrode was divided into several portions. One portion was directly used as a cathode for the formation of a cell with a lithium foil anode 99. 9% purity. The test cells were assembled inside an argon glovebox less than 1 ppm of H2O. The electrolyte was composed of a 3M bistriflouromethanesulfonylimide LiTFSI salt dissolved in a mixture of dimethoxyethane DME:1,3-dioxane DIOX solvents as electrolyte. 0. 2 M LiNO3 Alfa Aesar, 99. 99% was added to the electrolyte as an electrolyte additive. The charge-discharge tests were conducted at 70 C. , between 3. 0 and 1. 2 V vs. Li/Li+ in a galvanostatic mode. As shown, the conventional cell shows less than 150 stable cycles top graph. Another portion of the electrode was additionally coated with a conformal layer of aluminum oxide around 5 nm by using a plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition ALD technique. After the shell formation by ALD, the cell was assembled with the alumina coated electrode in exactly the same way as for the conventional electrode. The same electrolyte composition and testing regime was used.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Lithium-ion battery cells have seen widespread use in small consumer devices such as laptop computers and mobile telephones. Lithium-ion batteries have begun recently to supplant conventional batteries in applications having greater electrical energy demands, such as electrical vehicles and static electricity generation apparatus. Lithium-ion batteries are seeing increased use on account of their normally superior performance over conventional batteries, such as lead-acid and NiMH batteries, in particular in respect of energy storage density and power density. To meet electrical energy demand in such larger energy demand applications a battery is typically comprised of plural lithium-ion battery cells which are arranged in at least one of series and parallel depending on current and voltage requirements. Battery management systems for lithium-ion battery arrangements are known. Such a battery management system typically measures properties such as current, voltage and temperature in a battery and makes determinations concerning safe and effective operation based on the measurements. Battery management systems typically involve communication between each individual battery cell or each group of battery cells and management circuitry. Some known approaches make use of wired digital communication. For example according to a known approach, battery cells are configured as plural modules with non-isolated wired communication within each module and isolated wired communication according to the CAN bus protocol outside the modules. Isolation is required in respect of communication between individual battery cells or modules because each battery cell or module sits at a different voltage relative to system ground. The variation in voltage relative to system ground may amount to many hundreds of volts in a typical battery arrangement. Isolation to many kilovolts may therefore be required. Other known communication approaches make use of wireless communication protocols provided by the like of WiFi or ZigBee compliant circuitry operating on top of a Physical Layer such as provided by Short Range Devices SRDs according to ERC Recommendation 70-03. In such other known approaches, each battery cell or group of battery cells comprises an antenna and communicates by way of a broadcast radio channel to all of the other battery cells or groups of battery cells. The thus established wireless network is multi-drop in nature and is therefore suited to multi-cell battery application. A multi-drop network comprises slave nodes and a master node which may control timing of communication and may be operative as an interface to external systems. The slave nodes are connected to the network in the same fashion. Any slave node can drop out of the network without compromising the operation or communication capability of the remaining slave nodes. The multi-drop network is therefore advantageous for multi-cell battery arrangements which often comprise a large number of cells or groups of cells with each multi-cell battery arrangement having one of many different configurations. The above described radio frequency communication approaches are intended for operation in far field applications. In far field applications at frequencies up to 10 GHz or thereabout, each of the plural antennas is electrically short, i. e. each antenna is shorter than a wavelength of the radio waves, and the plural antennas are separated from each other by many wavelengths whereby the radio channels operate properly. However the present inventors have appreciated that in a typical battery application the dimensions of the battery are such that the antennas are separated from each other by distances that are up to around one wavelength. The reduction in separation from intended operation creates standing waves which give rise to peaks and troughs in radio signal strength whereby performance is degraded. Furthermore, the above described open to air radio frequency networks are susceptible to external interference. Measures are therefore taken to address the effects of external interference such as enclosing the whole battery arrangement within a metal screen. However screening can compromise network performance. Providing for complete screening, for example by placing a metal lid over the battery arrangement, has been found in certain circumstances to give rise to standing waves in the screen which can cause battery cells or modules to lose communication. The present invention has been devised in light of the inventors' appreciation of the above-mentioned problems with known radio frequency communication approaches. It is therefore an object for the present invention to provide an improved arrangement comprising plural electric battery cell modules, the arrangement being configured for electromagnetic coupling of data within the arrangement. It is a further object for the present invention to provide an improved electric battery arrangement comprising plural electric battery cell modules, the electric battery arrangement being configured for electromagnetic coupling of data within the electric battery arrangement.",
                    "DESCRIPTION": "A block diagram representation of an electric battery arrangement 10 according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in 1. The electric battery arrangement 10 comprises plural lithium-ion polymer electric battery cells 12 which are electrically coupled together to form an electric battery which provides required levels of voltage and current in dependence on the combined contribution of the electric battery cells. Each electric battery cell 12 comprises current, voltage and temperature sensors and circuitry configured to perform signal conditioning on sensed signals and to convert sensed signals into digital form. Each electric battery cell 12 also comprises a microprocessor which is operative to receive sensed signals in digital form and to form data packets in digital form comprising data based on the sensed signals. Each electric battery cell 12 further comprises an active transceiver which is electrically coupled to a module antenna 14. The transceiver is configured to receive the data packets from the microprocessor and to transmit the data packets by way of the module antenna 14. The transceiver is also configured to receive data packets comprising control data from the module antenna and to convey the received data packets to the microprocessor. The microprocessor is then operative to extract the control data from the thus received data packets for application of the extracted control data in the electric battery cell 12. The control data provides, for example, for the like of connection and disconnection of the electric battery cell 12 from the other electric battery cells and control of charge balancing between electric battery cells. The electric battery arrangement 10 further comprises an elongated transmission line in the form of a microstrip 16 which extends along the electric battery cells 12 such that it is close to the module antennas comprised in the electric battery cells. The transmission line is operative as an antenna. The transmission line 16 is terminated at one end with an end termination 18 of 50 Ohms such that the end termination is matched to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. The other end of the transmission line 16 is electrically coupled to a primary active transceiver 20 which is configured to couple data packets to and from the transmission line. The form and function of the module antennas and the transmission line are described further below with reference to 2. The electric battery arrangement 10 yet further comprises battery management system circuitry 22 which is configured to receive data packets comprising measurement data from the primary transceiver 20 and to send data packets comprising control data to the primary transceiver 20. The battery management system circuitry 22 is operative to perform processing of measurement data extracted from received data packets, to make determinations based on the extracted measurement data and to generate control data based on the determinations with such control data then being formed as data packets for transmission to one or more electric battery cells 12. The battery management system circuitry 22 is also configured to control timing of communication between the transmission line 16 and the module antennas 14. The battery management system circuitry 22 is further configured to be operative as an interface to a system 24 external to the electric battery arrangement 10. The external system 24 is, for example, a supervisory or monitoring system operative on computing apparatus. In another un-illustrated embodiment of the present invention the electric battery cells 12 of the embodiment of 1 are not electrically coupled together whereby no electric battery is formed. This embodiment is constituted when the plural electric battery cells are in storage such as in a warehouse or in a transport container such as in a shipping container. According to the storage application, the transmission line is comprised in the like of a rack in a warehouse, the rack supporting the electric battery cells. According to the transport application, the transmission line is comprised in the like of a shipping container holding the electric battery cells. Otherwise the present embodiment is of the same form and function as described herein with reference to 1 to 5. The second embodiment is thus configured to provide for battery management operations whilst the electric battery cells are in the like of storage or transport and are not operative together as an electric battery. The transmission line 16 of the electric battery arrangement 10 of 1 is shown in 2 for clarity with only one 12 of the electric battery cells. As can be seen from 2, the module antenna 14 has the form of a single loop 26 of rectilinear form which is backed by a ground plane 28. Each side of the loop 26 is 10 mm long. The module antenna 14 is located at the top of the electric battery cell 12 such that the transmission line 16 is positioned over the module antenna with a gap of a few millimetres in between. The gap is filled with a dielectric material, for example a gaseous dielectric such as air or a solid dielectric such as of a plastics material. The transmission line 16 has the form of a microstrip such that it comprises a single PCB track of predetermined width with a ground plane on the other side of the PCB supporting the single PCB track. The transceivers of the electric battery arrangement 10 are Short Range Device SRD transceiver devices operating at 868 MHz and 915 MHz. In another embodiment, the transmission line 16 of 2 is replaced with coaxial cable. A recess is formed in a solid dielectric layer present above the module antenna such that the recess follows the same path as the transmission line 16 shown in 2 whereby the recess is aligned with a centreline of the module antenna. The coaxial cable is received in the recess. In yet another embodiment the transmission line 16 of 2 is replaced with twisted pair cable. As per the previous embodiment, a recess is formed in a solid dielectric layer above the module antenna such that the recess follows the same path as the transmission line 16 shown in 2 whereby the recess is aligned with a centreline of the module antenna. The recess of the present embodiment is of a width such that when the twisted pair cable is received in the recess the two conductors of the twisted pair cable are constrained to lie substantially in a plane orthogonal to the plane in which the module antenna lies. The two conductors of the twisted pair cable should preferably be arranged such that they do not cross each other where a module antenna is present and should preferably, in so far is possible, lie parallel to each other where a module antenna is present. In a further embodiment, the transmission line 16 of 2 is replaced with a single conductor. As per the previous embodiment, a recess is formed in a solid dielectric layer above the module antenna such that the recess follows the same path as the transmission line 16 shown in 2 whereby the recess is aligned with a centreline of the module antenna. The single conductor is received in the recess. Operation of the electric battery arrangement 10 will now be described with reference to 1 and 2. In the absence of the module antennas 14, the transmission line 16 is matched to the primary transceiver 20 whereby all the energy transmitted by the primary transceiver 20 is absorbed by the end termination 18. When a module antenna 14 is located under the transmission line 16, it causes a reflection or mismatch at that location on the transmission line 16. The mismatch causes reflections which in turn cause standing waves to form along the transmission line 16. The standing waves appear as peaks and dips as one moves along the transmission line 16. The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio or VSWR is a measure of system matching. The VSWR is the ratio of the maximum and minimum AC voltages along the transmission line 16. An ideal system has a ratio of 1. 0, i. e. no peaks or troughs along the transmission line. To ensure that all the electric battery cell transceivers see much the same energy i. e. no or minimal peaks or troughs the VSWR as seen by the transmission line 16 should be kept below a predetermined value. In the present application, the VSWR is no more than 1. 5. This means that the sum of the power reflected from all of the module antennas 14 and the end termination 18 should be less than about 20%. To reduce reflections from each module antenna 14, the coupling strength between the module antenna and the transmission line 16 should be kept very low. The electric battery arrangement 10 is thus configured to provide near field weak electromagnetic coupling of data between the transmission line and each of the battery cells. Calculations relating to operation of the electric battery arrangement 10 will now be provided. As mentioned above, it is desired that the overall VSWR be maintained at a level no more than 1. 5. This means that the reflection coefficient seen at the primary transceiver 20 should be less than 0. 2. The total reflection from the communication network, as seen from the primary transceiver 20, is given by: i n = S 11 + Ncells S 12 S 21 1 - S 22 l l Equation 1 where in is the reflection coefficient seen at the primary transceiver, l is the reflection seen at the module antenna, and Sxy are the scattering parameters for that antenna connected to the communication network. The summation is over Ncells, i. e. the number of module antennas. The most important scattering parameters are S12 and S21, which are the reverse and forward voltage gains respectively. The reverse and forward voltage gains are each a measure of the coupling strength from the transmission line to the module antenna and vice versa. The reverse and forward voltage gains can be assumed to be identical. It is the coupling strength that is optimised to provide reliable operation independent of the number of electric battery cells in the electric battery arrangement 10. If the coupling strength were zero, then the reflection coefficient in would be set solely by the transmission line S11. However, communications would fail as there would be insufficient signal power for the receiver of the transceivers to operate. The minimum power required for a receiver to properly decode a received signal is the sensitivity, which is usually measured in dBm. Subtracting the sensitivity from the transmit power gives the dynamic range of the communication link and sets the minimum coupling strength that allows the communication link to operate. In practice, a 10 dB or 20 dB margin is provided for communication link robustness. For a typical Short Range Device transceiver of the kind comprised in the electric battery arrangement 10, the sensitivity is around 95 dBm and the transmit power is 10 dBm. This yields a minimum S12 and S21 value of 85 dB. A 10 dB margin then gives a practical minimum of 75 dB to thereby meet the requirement that the coupling strength is sufficiently high that the signal power is sufficiently above the minimum required for the communication link to operate reliably. The remaining constraint is to ensure the S12 and S21 values are sufficiently small that the VSWR is maintained at a level no more than 1. 5. Rearranging Equation 1 above we obtain: Ncells = i n - S 11 1 - S 22 L S 12 S 21 L Equation 2 Equation 2 provides for plotting of a graph of coupling strength against number of module antennas as shown in 3. 3 shows both of the above described constraints. As can be seen from 3, as the number of electric battery cells 10 and hence module antennas in the electric battery arrangement 10 increases the permissible coupling strength drops. It should be noted that irrespective of the number of electric battery cells 10 the coupling strength should remain above the lower straight line shown in 3 defined by the line of small squares. A margin should be allowed for to provide for system robustness. The grey shaded triangle in 3 defines an operating area which provides such a margin. Experimental results will now be provided. In an experimental arrangement, up to six open microstrip transmission lines were connected in series with an end termination of 50 Ohms. The transmission lines were loaded with 132 module antennas comprising a mixture of dummy loads, which were configured to appear electrically like an active load, and a smaller number of active loads configured with the Short Range Device transceiver device operating at 915 MHz. Communication in accordance with a protocol was achieved successfully in the experimental arrangement. The Received Signal Strength Indicator RSSI showed a coupling of about 40 dB for a single cell transceiver on the microstrip. This changed little when extended to six fully loaded microstrips. By varying the separation of the active load from the microstrip, the sensitivity was determined. Qualitatively the communication network worked well when the module antenna was within 20 to 30 mm of the microstrip. Beyond 30 mm the RSSI reduced rapidly until communication failed. With more than 100 mm of separation there was no signal detected. The module antenna was moved laterally across the microstrip by about 10 mm with little change in performance. The RSSI readings suggested that there is a first peak in coupling as one arm of the antenna loop moves over the microstrip, a small dip when the loop is centred, and a second peak in coupling as the other arm of the antenna loop passes over the microstrip, before falling away rapidly. This is desirable behaviour as the sweet spot is quite broad whereby requirement for precision in location of module antennas relative to the microstrip is reduced. Moving the module antenna along the microstrip provided signs of standing waves, as would be expected. Measurements of coupling strength in dB as the module antenna is moved along the transmission line are shown in 4. As can be seen from 4 the variation in coupling strength is 10 dB to 15 dB which corresponds to a VSWR of about 1. 4. A Vector Network Analyser was then used to measure the scattering parameters as the frequency of operation of the transceivers was varied between 700 MHz and 1. 1 GHz. The measurements are represented in 5 which shows a graph of variation in coupling strength in the form of forward voltage gain against frequency for each of six module antennas arranged along the transmission line. The coupling strength determined by way of the Vector Network Analyser corresponded well with what had been determined from RSSI measurements. As can be seen from 5, the response over the desired frequency range of 850 MHz to 950 MHz is generally flat with about 20 dB of variation for change of module antenna location along the microstrip.",

                    "FIELD_OF_INVENTION": "In at least one aspect, the present invention relates to sodium-ion batteries, and in particular, to sodium-ion batteries having anodes that include red phosphorus. In another aspect, the present invention relates to sodium-ion batteries having anodes that include black phosphorus.",
                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Red phosphorus RP has attracted considerable attention as the anode for high-performance Na-ion batteries, owing to its low cost and high theoretical specific capacity of 2,600 mAh/g. In energy storage technology, lithium-ion batteries have dominant power supply of portable devices and electrical vehicle due to its high energy density and stable cycling performance. The looming cost and environmental limits of this promising battery system has led to an exploration of several alternative strategies, such as sodium-ion battery. However, the anode part becomes the main drawback of sodium-ion batteries because the typical graphite anode employed in lithium-ion batteries does not intercalate with sodium ions thermodynamically; this problem is related to the larger size of the sodium ions, and thus makes it impossible to simply adopt the recent knowledge developed for high performance lithium-ion batteries directly onto sodium-ion chemistry. Recently, anode materials for sodium-ion batteries that have been investigated include metal oxides, alloys, two-dimensional compounds, and carbonaceous materials. Phosphorus offers much promise because it alloys with sodium at a high specific capacity of 2596 mAh/g when Na3P is formed. Due to the unstable property and toxicity of white phosphorus, black phosphorus and red phosphorus are the two major forms explored for sodium-ion storage. Thanks to the high conductance and the two-dimensional material nature, several promising studies of black phosphorus were reported with stable high capacity with impressive rate capability up to 10 C charge/discharge rate were reported. However, the intrinsic challenges stemming from the high cost and sophisticated synthesis of black phosphorus promote red phosphorus to a better position in sodium-ion chemistry. Recently, several red phosphorus anodes developed with ball-milling technique and carbonaceous scaffold were presented to solve the poor conductivity, slow sodium ion transport kinetics, and large volume variation during cycling. On the other hand, due to the rising importance of the wearable electronics, flexible power sources employing free-standing electrodes using carbon nanotube, carbon nanofiber, carbon cloth, and graphene-based flexible electrodes frames have attracted a lot of interest for both lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. Therefore, there is great importance to combine red phosphorus with carbonaceous material-based flexible platforms, such as graphene free-standing film. Accordingly, there is a need for improved methods for forming battery anodes that include red phosphorus.",
                    "SUMMARY": [
                        "In at least one aspect of the present invention method to deposit red phosphorus nanodots densely and uniformly onto reduced graphene oxide sheets P@RGO to minimize the sodium ion diffusion length and the sodiation/desodiation stresses, and the RGO network also serves as electron pathway and creates free space to accommodate the volume variation of phosphorus particles. The resulted P@RGO flexible anode achieved 1165. 4, 510. 6, and 135. 3 mAh/g specific charge capacity at 159. 4, 31878. 9, and 47818. 3 mA/g charge/discharge current density in rate capability test, and a 914 mAh/g capacity after 300 deep cycles in cycling stability test at 1593. 9 mA/g current density, which marks a significant performance improvement for red phosphorus anodes for sodium-ion chemistry and flexible power sources for wearable electronics. In another aspect, a facile single-step flash-heat treatment was developed to achieve the reduction of graphene oxide GO and the simultaneous deposition of RP onto the reduced graphene oxide rGO sheets is provided. The resulting RP/rGO composite was shown to be a promising candidate for overcoming the issues associated with the poor electronic conductivity and large volume variation of RP during cycling. The RP/rGO flexible film anode delivered an average capacity of 1,625 mAh/g during 200 cycles at a charge/discharge current density of 1 A/g. Average charge capacities of 1,786, 1,597, 1,324, and 679 mAh/g at 1, 2, 4, and 6 A/g current densities were obtained in the rate capability tests. Moreover, owing to the RP component, the RP/rGO film presented superior flame retardancy compared to an rGO film. This work thus introduces a highly accessible synthesis method to prepare flexible and safe RP anodes with superior electrochemical performance toward Na-ion storage. In another aspect, a method for forming a black phosphorus-containing anode to be used in a sodium ion battery is provided. The method includes a step of arranging red phosphorus powder and graphene oxide powder in a layered structure having alternating layers of phosphorus powder and graphene oxide. The layered structure is heat treated at a first temperature to form a red phosphorus/reduced graphene oxide combination film. The red phosphorus/reduced graphene oxide combination film is then placed on a substrate. A pressure is applied to the red phosphorus/reduced graphene oxide combination film that is sufficient to convert the red phosphorus to black phosphorus such that a black phosphorus/reduced graphene oxide combination film is formed. Characteristically, the pressure is greater than or equal to about 5 GPa. The pressure is typically applied with the red phosphorus/reduced graphene oxide combination being at a second temperature of about 20 to 40 degrees C. Typically, the substrate is a metal sheet or metal foil that is used as a current collector in a battery.

                    "STATE_OF_THE_ART": "Across the globe, scientists are interested in what is coming after lithium batteries. The rechargeable batteries have become the dominant power source in any number of consumer electronics, from phones to cars. It has been suggested that the global lithium ion battery market will hit 100 billion by 2024. However, that growth comes with several challenges. For example, there are limited sources suitable for large-scale lithium extraction. In addition, lithium extraction results in extreme environmental impacts, such as heavy water consumption. Thus, there is a continued need for replacement of lithium-based batteries. Calcium has the potential to act as a replacement. For example, it is already used in lead acid batteries, which are often seen in automotive starter motors. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, with equal geographical resource distribution around the globe. Calcium also lacks lithium's troublesome trait of catching fire. The challenge for the adoption of calcium has been finding a workable electrolyte. Within batteries, an electrolyte is a medium that allows the battery to move ions from one place to another. For a battery to work, it needs to transfer ions from its cathode to its anode and back. Electrolytes come in many varieties, including soluble salts, acids, or other bases in liquid, gelled, and dry formats.",

                        "1 illustrates both single cycle and multiple cycle data for CaHMDS2 dissolved in THF at a concentration of 1 M, in accordance with various embodiments Ptw, Ptc, Caref, 25 mV/s. CaHMDS2 was synthesized and rigorously dried THF Na/benzophenone was used. Hexamethyldisilazide has a pKa reported to be 26, so it will drive CaOs formation in the electrolyte, consuming water. Cyclic voltammetry for Ca electrodeposition is shown at upper right for a single scan and 15 repetitive scans shown at lower right. Electrodeposition appears relatively reversible and very high current densities, &gt;30 mA cm2 at 25 mV s1 were observed. 1 also provides the chemical structure of HMD 2 is a plot of average Coulombic efficiency versus mole fraction for CaHMDS2 dissolved in THF, in accordance with various embodiments. Transition at mole fraction=0. 06-0. 07. Low coulombic efficiency at low CaHMDS2 mole fraction was observed. Plot shows a transition in coulombic efficiency, with markedly higher values at higher [CaHMDS2]. It is believed that at very high mole fractions of CaHMDS2, essentially all THF is coordinated by Ca2+ i. e. free [THF] is approximately zero. Infrared spectroscopy was used to examine any changes in the electrolyte over this concentration range. 3 illustrates FTIR of THF at increasing CaHMDS2 mole fraction. In particular, FTIR results show the 910 cm1 region of THF that allows differentiation of free and coordinated THF. As demonstrated, THF ring mode shows decreasing free THF 910 cm1 and increasing coordinated THF 875 cm1 as mole fraction of CaHMDS2 increases. Sigmoidal fit also showed inflection point at mole fraction of 0. 066, consistent with the CE results. Saturation at mole fraction 0. 16 is consistent with a solvate IL, [CaHMDSTHF6][HMDS]. 4 illustrates 17 mM CaTFSI2 in BMP TFSI ionic liquid wherein coulombic efficiency starts at less than 50% and current density degrades with cycling and Ca2+/Ca showed only limited reversibility in BMP TFSI Ptw, Ptc, Ptref, 50 mV/s. 5 illustrates Ca2+/Ca in BMP TFSI ionic liquid+diglyme and BH4. As illustrated, diglyme and free BH4 did not have much effect. Best result for coulombic efficiency was Ca 65% per cycle. Studies illustrated that strategies that were effective for Mg2+/Mg are not effective for Ca2+/Ca. 6 illustrates cycling as a function of [CaHMDS2]/THF. Very high solubility was observed, enabling high current densities &gt;30 mA cm2 and studies over a wide range of concentrations. As concentration increased, current density was observed to increase and then decrease. Concentrated solutions are extremely viscous and higher viscosity can be a signature of a solvate ionic liquid. 7 illustrates cycling current densities for Ca2+/Ca in CaHMDS2/THF. Cycling demonstrates high current densities over multiple cycles. 30 mA cm2 is greater than 2 higher than any previously reported for Ca and much higher &gt;10 Ox than Mg. This electrolyte has characteristics of a solvate ionic liquid or a solvent-in-salt. Ca/Ca2+ shows superior cycling behavior in the solvate ionic liquid compared to lower concentrations. 8 is a graph illustrating the effect of amine concentration on reversible deposition 9 is a graph illustrating the effect of CaHMDS2 concentration on reversible deposition 10 illustrates the effect of cyclic charging and discharging."

The next frontier is multi-electron battery systems based on metals such as, for example, Mg2+ and Ca2+. Over the past several years considerable effort has been spent on Mg2+ battery science while little work has been done on calcium batteries. However, it is disclosed herein that calcium batteries are advantageous and attractive for a number of reasons. For example, on a volumetric basis, Calcium is just as attractive as Li 2072 mA hr cm3; and 2062 mA hr cm3, respectively. Part of the issue is that calcium metal is even more reducing than Mg, with a similar reduction potential to Li. This potent reducing power drives electrolyte decomposition, leading to poor reversibility. Attempts to reversibly deposit calcium metal have, for the most part, failed. One recent paper describes how CaBH42 may be dissolved in tetrahydrofuran THF, and that this electrolyte allows reasonably reversible deposition and dissolution of calcium metal. However, the paper further indicates that the calcium metal reacts with THF, producing a surface film containing CaH2 calcium hydride, which thus fouls the surface. The CaH2 surface film thus interferes with achieving high coulombic efficiency, because its formation consumes calcium metal Plating and stripping calcium in an organic electrolyte, by: Wang, Da; Gao, Xiangwen; Chen, Yuhui; et al. NATURE MATERIALS Volume: 17 Issue: 1, Pages: 16-20. Published: January 2018. Thus additional calcium based batteries are needed. Disclosed herein is a calcium based rechargeable battery. The calcium based rechargeable battery includes a calcium salt that comprises or consists of a Ca2+ cation and two hydrocarbon substituted disilazide anions. The calcium based rechargeable battery further includes at least one solvent, suitable for calcium battery cycling, for example a solvent that can solvate the Ca2+ cation and the two hydrocarbon substituted disilazide anions. In embodiments, the calcium salt is a Ca2+ cation and two hydrocarbon substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof, such as, such as NSiMe3SiMe2tBu, where tBu refers to a tertiary butyl group, NSiMe3SiPh2tBu, where Ph refers to a phenyl group, NSiMePh22, NSiMe3SiPh3, or NSiMe3Mes, where Mes refers to a mesityl group or NSiMe3Dipp, where Dipp refers to 2,6-di-isopropylaniline. In embodiments, a calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof, enables high current densities and high coulombic efficiency for calcium metal deposition and dissolution. These properties facilitate the use of this salt in batteries based on calcium metal. In addition, the salt is significant for batteries based on metal anodes, which have higher specific energies than batteries based on intercalation anodes, such as LiC6, the anode used in most rechargeable Li batteries today. It is noted that, in embodiments, the calcium salt is preferably highly soluble such as &gt;1 M in the solvent, or solvent system used, thereby enabling very high concentrations of the Ca2+-containing solution species that are reduced at the battery's anode during charging. In embodiments, the high concentration of the Ca2+-containing solution enables high current densities to be used. In embodiments, high solubility of the calcium salt enables the production of very high local concentrations of soluble Ca2+-containing species during battery discharge. On the other hand, low solubility such as &lt;10 mM generally limits the current densities that can be used during charging and discharging. In embodiments, the calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof enables even high concentrations of Ca2+ to be dissolved in various solvents suitable for calcium battery cycling. In embodiments, the calcium salt dissociates, in solution with at least one solvent, into Ca2+ and HMDS ions or derivatives thereof such that the total concentration of Ca2+ in all its speciated forms is greater than or equal to 1. 0 M. In embodiments, the calcium salt is dissolved in the solvent at a concentration greater than a mole fraction of 0. 065. In embodiments, this high concentration has two beneficial effects: first, it enables very high current densities for calcium metal deposition and dissolution , &gt;30 mA/cm2 at 25 mV/s in an electrolyte comprised of calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof and any of a variety of solvents, including but not limited to tetrahydrofuran THF. Second, at sufficiently high concentrations of the calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions in THF, there is seen an unexpected increase in the coulombic efficiency for the calcium metal deposition/dissolution cycle. This increase may be attributed to the complexation of the solvent in the coordination sphere of the Ca2+ ion, such that there is only a very small concentration of free i. e. uncoordinated THF. Thus, it disclosed herein that this complexation prevents deleterious reactions of THF with the calcium metal anode, thereby enabling high coulombic efficiency. In this embodiment, the amount of free THF in the electrolyte is reduced, because much of it is coordinated in the Ca2+ coordination sphere. The Ca2+-THF complex is more stable toward calcium metal than free THF. In embodiments, a fraction of THF in the electrolyte that is coordinated in a coordination sphere of the Ca2+ is sufficiently high to prevent deleterious reactions with a calcium metal anode. In embodiments, the concentration of free THF is one of: 10 mole %, such as below 10 mole %, including below 9 mole %, below 8 mole %, below 7 mole %, below 6 mole %, below 5 mole %, below 4 mole %, below 3 mole %, below 2 mole %, below 1 mole %, below 0. 1 mole %, below 0. 01 mole %, for example, between 10 mole % and 0. 01%, or between 1 mole % and 0. 01 mole %, between 1 mole % and 0. 1 mole %, between 0. 1 mole % and 0. 01 mole %, such as 9 mole %, 8 mole %, 7 mole %, 6 mole %, 5 mole %, 4 mole %, 3 mole %, 2 mole %, 1 mole %, 0. 5 mole %, 0. 1 mole %, 0. 05 mole % or 0. 01 mole % of a total amount of solvent in the electrolyte. In embodiments, the solvent is THF and the concentration of calcium salt in the THF is between 1 M and 2. 47 M. It is noted that the calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, is not available commercially, and must be synthesized. Thus, heretofore it has not yet been explored as a salt for use in calcium-based batteries. In fact, the only salt that has been successfully studied for reversible calcium metal deposition/dissolution is CaBH42. While previous studies using this salt reported concentrations up to 1. 5 M, yielding current densities &lt;15 mA/cm2 at 25 mV/s, in stark contrast, the inventors' preliminary work with CaHMDS2 salt has yielded current densities that are better than this figure by more than a factor of two. Further, borohydride salts, such as CaBH42, are not suited for use in batteries, due to possible instability and release of hydrogen gas H2 during unwanted decomposition. Thus, substituted disilazide anions, such as HMDS, represent the only salts now known that provide high concentrations of Ca2+, thereby enabling current densities sufficiently high to enable reasonable battery performance. As a result, there are no known suitable salts that can serve as alternatives to achieve high solubility of Ca2+ in solvents suitable for rechargeable calcium batteries. An important feature for battery use is how high a coulombic efficiency for calcium metal deposition/dissolution using calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions may be obtained. At present, values as high as 80% have been observed, and going forward, it is expected that substantially higher values may be achieved by focusing on salt and solvent purity. Further, increased coulombic efficiency may be realized by exploring the electrochemical behavior of calcium salts having substituted disilazide anions, for example, a methyl-substituted disilazide anion such as hexamethyldisilazide also known as bistrimethylsilylamide, or a derivative thereof in other solvents, such as, for example, amine solvents, such as dimethylethylamine. In embodiments, a calcium based rechargeable battery includes a CaHMDS2 salt and at least one solvent, suitable for calcium battery cycling. In embodiments, the at least one solvent includes THF. Alternatively, for example, the at least one solvent may include one or more of: diethyl ether, diisopropylether, methyl t-butyl ether MTBE, 1,3-dioxane, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydropyran, glyme, diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme or an amine based solvent, such as N,N-dimethylethylamine DMEA, triethylamine TEA, and tetramethylethylenediamine TMEDA. In embodiments, a calcium based rechargeable battery does not include CaBH42. In embodiments, the calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof dissociates in solution with the solvent into Ca2+ and HMDS ions, the concentration of Ca2+ being greater than or equal to 3. 0M. In embodiments, batteries made using the calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof may include either a liquid electrolyte comprised of this salt dissolved in any of the solvents listed above, or, for example, a polymer gel electrolyte comprised of this salt in a dissolved state in any of the solvents listed above, and mixed with a suitable polymer matrix , a polymer gel electrolyte. The cathode of the battery may use a redox active material capable of Ca2+ insertion, such as, for example, V2O5, Mn2O4, MnO2, or any of a number of cathode materials previously used for Na+ insertion. In embodiments, this class of materials would be suitable based on the similar ionic sizes of Na+ and Ca2+. Examples of such materials include NaMnFe2PO43, NaVO3, Na2FeP2O7, or the like. 1-7 described how at high concentrations of CaHMDS2, the electrolyte has characteristics of a solvate ionic liquid IL. It is here noted that an ionic liquid is simply a low melting salt. The typical definition is that it is in its liquid state at temperatures below 100 degrees C. In contrast, a solvate ionic liquid is one in which essentially all of the solvent is engaged in direct, inner sphere bonding with the metal ion. Under such circumstances, the free solvent content is vanishingly small, such as less than 10 mole %. Thus, in embodiments, an electrolyte system may be provided that includes calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof dissolved in various solvents as noted above, under conditions where the result is a solvate ionic liquid. These include, for example, compositions in which the calcium salt, having substituted disilazide anions, for example a methyl substituted disilazide anion, such as a hexamethyldisilazide anion also known as bistrimethylsilylamide or a derivative thereof has a mole fraction higher than 0. 14. As described in the Example below, this value is based upon a sigmoidal fit of the FTIR spectroscopic data, which shows a limiting value achieved somewhere between 0. 14 and 0. 16 mole fraction of CaHMDS2. It is contemplated that methods in addition to spectroscopic tools may be used to define where the solvate composition occurs. The following example is provided to illustrate particular features of certain embodiments. However, the particular features described below should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the disclosure, but rather as examples from which equivalents will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.",
