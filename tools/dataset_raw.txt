50 F Therefore, the transmitter transmits additional bits for increasing the probability that all of the CBs included in the TB will be successfully decoded.
50 S However, this method has a disadvantage in that the amount of control information transmitted over a feedback channel is increased, and because CBs in which an error occurs, among CBs included in a CBG, are not known, resources are still wasted.
50 R Sending more bits improve decoding but increase channel usage.
50 R Increase success rate leads to more channel usage.

51 F The skid landing gear may provide energy attenuation in various types of landings, including normal landings, hard landings, auto-rotations, and crash landings.
51 S However, sizing the skid members in such a manner may lead to an increase in the overall weight of the skid members and the landing gear.
51 R Skid allow for better landing but also increase weight.
51 R Adding another equipment add functionality but add more weight.

52 F The software industry is adopting multi-tenancy to achieve more economical usage of hardware through higher density and reduced maintenance cost.
52 S However, conventional multi-tenant architecture does not have support for the sharing of the common metadata across tenants while maintaining the segregation of tenant private metadata.
52 R Sharing server improve server usage and reduce cost but do not allow to share common data. 
52 R Sharing ressource improve usage and cost but is less flexible. 

53 F In addition to presenting organic content describing users, a social networking system may also present advertisements to its users, allowing the social networking system to obtain revenue by charging advertisers for presentation of the advertisements.
53 S However, presenting advertisements and organic content together divides a user's attention between the advertisements and the organic content, decreasing the amount of user interaction with the organic content, which may decrease overall user interaction with the social networking system.
53 R Social networking system can present advertisements to its users to make money but it reduces user interaction.
53 R Increasing the number of advertisements reduce user's attention.

54 F These advantages allow BLDC motors to be more efficient than other types of motors, which can result in less energy consumption and lower operational costs of motorized devices.
54 S However, the use of multiple Hall Effect sensors increases the cost and complexity of the motor by requiring additional hardware, which also increases the size and weight of the motor.
54 R Brushless motors reduce energy usage and operating cost but sensors increase complexity, cost, size and weight.
54 R Specific motors can consume less energy and cacn be cheaper but they require more complexity, mass and volume.

55 F In order to perform such training of the deep learning network, training data are needed in which labels are added to individual data by labelers.
55 S Therefore, it takes a long time to generate true labels for entire training images.
55 R

56 F One approach for increasing the reliability and capacity of existing 12V systems would be to provide an additional battery in the vehicle, either to work as a backup for the main battery, or to operate in parallel with a second battery.
56 S However, an additional 12V battery would add significant and undesirable weight, cost and complexity to the vehicle.

57 S 
58 F It is essential for these silicon nitride films to exhibit excellent electrical properties whilst maintaining a low thermal budget
58 S However, the formation of unwanted silicon-rich particles has been observed during such low temperature PECVD processes.
58 R ------
59 F Recently, achieving higher performance, weight reduction, and thickness reduction of electronic devices, communication devices, personal computers, smart phones and the like has accelerated, semiconductor packages are also required to be reduced in size.
59 S However, since a prepreg, which is a laminated material among conventional package components, includes a woven glass fabric, it is difficult to reduce the thickness by more than a certain amount.
