2 F Air flow through the gas turbine engine can be controlled, in part, by using variable vanes and such variable vanes have been used to control the incidence of air flow onto rotor blades of subsequent compressor stages under different operating conditions.
2 S However, the inclusion of variable vanes in the low-pressure compressor, as well as the associated linkages and actuators, necessarily adds additional weight to the gas turbine engine as well as increasing cost and complexity of manufacturing the gas turbine engine.
2 R including variable vanes allow a better control of the air flow trough the engine, however it makes it heavier, more expensive and more complex to build. 

4 F Such inks or coating agents should exhibit excellent adhesion to different kinds of plastic films and should also exhibit blocking resistance and adaptability to boiling or retorting treatment.
4 S However, polyurethane resins in which the urethane bond concentration is highly increased do not provide sufficient adaptability for printing or adhesion stability.
4 R Such inks have excellent properties but they don't interact well with polyurethane

5 F As the optical technique develops, solid-state lighting devices have great improvements in light-emitting efficiency, lifetime, and brightness.
5 S However, the light generated by the LED may undergo total internal reflection inside the semiconductor layers and the substrate.
5 R LED's lifetime, bightness and energy consumption have improved, however, light is not efficiently extracted from the LED and can be reflected inside the material, reducing the overall efficiency.

7 F By doing so, each node may participate in the network with anonymity, connection failure, or insufficient reliability.
7 S However, private blockchains may be subject to reliability issues due to their centralized control system and consensus structure.
7 R Allowing nodes to participate in the blockchain with low reliability, low connection or anonymously will boost the systems's operability but it may cause reliability issues because of the centralised control and consensus architecture.

50 F Therefore, the transmitter transmits additional bits for increasing the probability that all of the CBs included in the TB will be successfully decoded.
50 S However, this method has a disadvantage in that the amount of control information transmitted over a feedback channel is increased, and because CBs in which an error occurs, among CBs included in a CBG, are not known, resources are still wasted.
50 R Sending more bits improves decoding but increases channel usage.
50 R Increase success rate leads to more channel usage.

51 F The skid landing gear may provide energy attenuation in various types of landings, including normal landings, hard landings, auto-rotations, and crash landings.
51 S However, sizing the skid members in such a manner may lead to an increase in the overall weight of the skid members and the landing gear.
51 R Skid allow for better landing but also increase weight.
51 R Adding another equipment add functionality but add more weight.

52 F The software industry is adopting multi-tenancy to achieve more economical usage of hardware through higher density and reduced maintenance cost.
52 S However, conventional multi-tenant architecture does not have support for the sharing of the common metadata across tenants while maintaining the segregation of tenant private metadata.
52 R Sharing server improve server usage and reduce cost but do not allow to share common data. 
52 R Sharing ressource improve usage and cost but is less flexible. 

53 F In addition to presenting organic content describing users, a social networking system may also present advertisements to its users, allowing the social networking system to obtain revenue by charging advertisers for presentation of the advertisements.
53 S However, presenting advertisements and organic content together divides a user's attention between the advertisements and the organic content, decreasing the amount of user interaction with the organic content, which may decrease overall user interaction with the social networking system.
53 R Social networking system can present advertisements to its users to make money but it reduces user interaction.
53 R Increasing the number of advertisements reduce user's attention.

54 F These advantages allow BLDC motors to be more efficient than other types of motors, which can result in less energy consumption and lower operational costs of motorized devices.
54 S However, the use of multiple Hall Effect sensors increases the cost and complexity of the motor by requiring additional hardware, which also increases the size and weight of the motor.
54 R Brushless motors reduce energy usage and operating cost but sensors increase complexity, cost, size and weight.
54 R Specific motors can consume less energy and cacn be cheaper but they require more complexity, mass and volume.
